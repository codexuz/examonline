**_Extract One_**

_Nathalie_: David, have you read this article about watching thriller movies?

_David_: No, is it good?

_Nathalie_: Yeah, well, I’d heard before that when we’re scared, our brains pump out the feel-good chemical dopamine, like when we’re in love with someone. But look at this: it says that families who like nothing better than sitting together on the sofa in front of a good thriller movie are the most contented. That’s news to me! Most people I know who adore thriller movies, appreciate them for the really good plot lines. You know, the stories are so rational in many ways that some otherwise very sensible people are drawn into them.

_David_: For me, when I watch horror movies, it’s like going on a mini vacation.

_Nathalie_: Do you mean you can wander oﬀ into a fantasy world?

_David_: More that it gives me ideas, even about how to solve issues at work. And I’ve heard other people say the same.

_Nathalie_: Really? I could understand it if you said something like it’s the suspense, the special eﬀects or the thrill you get from watching them.

_David_: Well, it may sound odd, but they leave me feeling more excited about possibilities to do with daily life.

**_Extract Two_**

_Woman_: I’ve just been reading an article about building skyways in cities. Their eﬀect on commerce, particularly shopping, can be considerable because when they link the upper floors of buildings, shops at ground level don’t get passing trade any more. Some even go bust.

_Man_: Absolutely. If people are walking about on the third or fourth floor, they won’t make a special trip down to the ground level to buy something, and that’s why so many stores are having to close, even when they’re in prime central locations.

_Woman_: I read they’re also struggling because people are buying online. And with online shopping, deliveries are becoming more eﬀicient. Plus centres are suﬀering because all those large shopping malls on the outskirts of towns were built to attract people by oﬀering a range of activities, like movie theatres.

_Man_: I think the two things are diﬀerent. But you know the arguments – skyways mean pedestrians can enjoy walking through a city in any weather, and there’s less crime than at street level. But, to my mind, getting people away from congested roads and sidewalks has to be the winning argument. Skyways have the potential to bring life back to city centres. After all, the centre is where people not only want to shop and work, but live too.

**_Extract Three_**

_Sophie_: So, Gary, you’re working on public information campaigns, aren’t you?

_Gary_: Yes, Sophie, I’m actually employed by the government and the thinking behind the public awareness campaigns this year is all about encouraging participation in sports at school.

_Sophie_: Yes, I saw the very successful TV campaign showing the importance of doing sport for healthy growth in primary-aged children. But isn’t that something that the public already knows?

_Gary_: Most people, yes, and that’s why we started with the health aspect. What’s less well understood, and what I want to get across, is how sport helps children mature socially by teaching them about teamwork and about fair play. I’d rather not focus on the discipline aspect – the idea that sports are all about learning sets of rules and sticking to them.

_Sophie_: Interesting. I’m looking into the eﬀect of sport on learning performance. My first study followed a group of children from primary school right through to university level. I tracked various things like how often they were absent through illness, and their grades, and what stood out was that those who did sport were much keener to try to get good grades in maths, English, those kinds of subjects.

_Gary_: And did they achieve that?

_Sophie_: Not always, but the aspiration was there. And for me, that’s what really counts.
