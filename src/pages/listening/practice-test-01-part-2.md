You will hear a citrus fruit grower, called Ben Tyrell, giving a presentation to students. For questions **7-14**, complete the sentences with a word or short phrase.

**CITRUS FRUIT FARMER**

Ben has an organic farm, so he relies primarily on (**7**) …………………………… to assess the health of his trees.

If the (**8**) …………………………… of a tree are the wrong colour, the tree usually requires fertiliser.

When to give trees fertiliser is determined principally by the (**9**) …………………………… .

To control fungi on the fruit, Ben uses (**10**) …………………………… as an organic fungicide.

Ben only worries about weeds if they are growing near his (**11**) …………………………… system.

The (**12**) …………………………… of the fruit is the last criterion to check before picking begins.

The only tool fruit pickers use is (**13**) ……………………………, otherwise fruit may be damaged.

Ben uses the phrase ‘(**14**) ……………………………’ to describe what he aims to teach school children.

<summary>Answer & Audioscript</summary>


**7 observation**   Synthetic pesticides are mentioned, but Ben doesn’t use them, and he says that observation is more important than the protection of young trees.

**8 leaves**   Bark is also mentioned, but it’s when leaves are discoloured that the tree needs fertiliser.

**9 weather**   Two factors are mentioned, but the weather is more important than the delivery dates.

**10 bacteria**   Other farmers use soap, but he doesn’t.

**11 irrigation**   Although he mentions grass mowers and a shed, these are not systems and don’t fit with the meaning of the sentence.

**12 size**   He checks the levels of sugar and juice, but the sentence is about what he does last.

**13 scissors**   Ladders and metal baskets are also mentioned, but Ben and his workers don’t use them.

**14 touch** **the earth**   He also uses the term ‘intelligent food choices’, but this doesn’t fit the meaning of the sentence.

**_Audioscript_**

_Ben_: Hi, I’d like to tell you a bit about myself and my work as a citrus fruit farmer. My name’s Ben Tyrell and my family’s been growing oranges, lemons and grapefruit for several generations. As an organic grower, I don’t use synthetic pesticides on our farm, so to ensure all the trees are healthy, observation becomes that much more important; even more important than, for example, the protection of young trees. If a tree needs fertiliser, there’ll be discoloration of the leaves rather than the bark. When a tree’s oﬀ-colour, it might be because it’s running low on potassium or nitrogen. Deciding _when_ to start putting some organic fertiliser on the trees has to be carefully calculated. It’ll depend partly on the deadlines for delivering the fruit to the packing house, but mainly on the weather. Do it at the wrong time and its eﬀiciency is greatly reduced.

In springtime, my day will also include checking the fungus situation on the fruit on the trees. At this time of year, we’re mainly concerned with the fungi Alternaria and Melanose. While harmless, if the fruit has either of these fungi, it’ll have blemishes and that’d put our fruit into a lower grade at the packing house. So, if we find any fungi, I use bacteria to attack and control the fungi as an organic solution to the problem. Some growers use a type of soap made from organic fats, but not me.

During the summer, weeds start growing up around the trees. We’re completely against using any sort of chemicals as a weed killer and I guess our neighbours might think our farm looks a bit messy, but I don’t get hung up about weeds. The only time we do something about them is when they start appearing right next to the irrigation setup. Then we might use small grass mowers that we keep in a shed to control the weeds.

In late fall, harvest time, I begin to check if the fruit’s ready to pick. In the US, there are state regulations for when to pick fruit. We have to check that the fruit contains certain levels of sugar and juice. After meeting these requirements, finally, we’ll look at size because there are regulations for that as well. So, when we’re sure the fruit is ready, we call in the pickers. All the fruit’s picked by hand – our workers use scissors so that we don’t damage the fruit. We don’t use ladders or metal baskets for the same reason.

I love growing organically and knowing that the fruit we produce is as healthy as it can be. We do tours of the farm for school kids because I’m keen that future generations can ‘touch the earth’, if you know what I mean. They can make what we call ‘intelligent food choices’, based on the knowledge of how a food was grown, how it was processed and how it was stored.

Now, any questions …
