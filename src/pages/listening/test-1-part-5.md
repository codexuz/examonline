<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><em>Extract One</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Juliet</em>: Hi, Adam. How are you finding living in Montreal?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Adam</em>: Hi, Juliet. It’s a great city and I’ve got some good buddies now, guys who live on our street and work colleagues. Are you going to the street party to celebrate Canada Day?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Juliet</em>: You bet. It’s a real important thing for me and my family; celebrating it is an annual ritual for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Adam</em>: I’ll see you there then; it’s going to be a beautiful day. <u>That sudden shift from biting cold gales to beautifully balmy evenings when you can sit outside in a T-shirt until midnight is what drew me to Montreal</u>. It’s awesome!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Juliet</em>: I know what you mean. So are you staying on in your apartment? I think you said you only leased it for a year?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Adam</em>: Yeah. It makes sense to rent in Montreal – <u>you don’t have to fork out a fortune for a place downtown</u>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Juliet</em>: <u>You can get a deal</u> because there’s so much on the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Adam</em>: And getting a place of my own is, well, financially out of the question. But quite a few people on our street are moving out, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Juliet</em>: Yeah, like my sister’s moving again. She wants to be more in the centre.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Adam</em>: Oh, OK.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><em>Extract Two</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Halim</em>: Hi, Soraya, how are you getting on with your essay on plastic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Soraya</em>: Hi, Halim. Well, the background reading’s fascinating. OK, there’s been a complete U-turn in the views expressed in journals and even in the popular press in recent years. But actually, <u>when I read about the 1950s, I get that at that time plastic was seen as revolutionary. You could make anything from it, from bottles to roofs; it was so strong and durable. What was not to like?</u> Whereas now, it’s seen as a real threat to the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Halim</em>: Yeah. I’ve read a couple of really thought-provoking articles and I watched the documentary our tutor recommended, you know the one called <em>Plastic Madness</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Soraya</em>: Oh yeah, any good?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Halim</em>: <u>Wildly over-dramatic at the end</u>, in my view. To be fair, it did go into the pros and cons of the uses of plastic, and it covered the main ideas we’d discussed in class, but <em>to close with statements like Most species of fish will be extinct within ten years was way over the top</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Soraya</em>: And did it go into issues like plastic causing air pollution?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Halim</em>: It did, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><em>Extract Three</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Ed</em>: So, Jane, I’m the parent of a sixteen-year-old, Max, and my wife and I are constantly wondering if we’re doing the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Jane</em>: The teenage years are critical in human development, Ed. <u>Parents are programmed to care for their child</u>, but in evolutionary terms, the infant must develop, mature and eventually separate from them. And although the majority of parents cope admirably with their child becoming a monosyllabic and at times diﬀicult teenager, <u>few know when to let go</u>. At the same time, parents do generally adapt well to having to provide more emotional support than physical support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Ed</em>: With Max, we’re going through things like, he seems reluctant to wake up before ten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Jane</em>: Some schools have changed their timetable to take into account the fact that teenagers perform better later in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><em>Ed</em>: Not his, unfortunately. The good thing is <u>Max and I are both seriously into gaming and I’m fascinated by how so many games promote universal values</u> like hard work pays oﬀ, collaboration works better than confrontation and thinking things through is to be admired. I encourage Max to invite his mates round to our house because I want him to build up a circle of good friends who share common interests.</span></p></div>
