<summary>Answer & Audioscript</summary>


**1 A**   B: Adam says he now has good friends in the community, but he doesn’t say this is what attracted him to Montreal. C: He mentions that he and his family love celebrating Canada Day, but he doesn’t say anything about the value other inhabitants put on celebrating that tradition.

**2 C**   A: Although they both mention people who are moving away from their street, neither of them comments on the frequency with which people move house in Montreal. B: Only Juliet mentions that her sister would like to live in the city centre.

**4 B**   A: Halim expresses the opposite opinion: ‘it did go into the pros and cons of the uses of plastic’. C: He also says that the documentary covered the significant points: ‘it covered the main ideas we’d discussed in class’.

**5 B**   A: Jane says parents cope well with their teenage children’s moods, which suggests they do understand them. C: She also suggests that parents do recognise that their children’s needs have changed because they adapt to giving more emotional support.

**_Extract One_**

_Juliet_: Hi, Adam. How are you finding living in Montreal?

_Adam_: Hi, Juliet. It’s a great city and I’ve got some good buddies now, guys who live on our street and work colleagues. Are you going to the street party to celebrate Canada Day?

_Juliet_: You bet. It’s a real important thing for me and my family; celebrating it is an annual ritual for us.

_Adam_: I’ll see you there then; it’s going to be a beautiful day. That sudden shift from biting cold gales to beautifully balmy evenings when you can sit outside in a T-shirt until midnight is what drew me to Montreal. It’s awesome!

_Juliet_: I know what you mean. So are you staying on in your apartment? I think you said you only leased it for a year?

_Adam_: Yeah. It makes sense to rent in Montreal – you don’t have to fork out a fortune for a place downtown.

_Juliet_: You can get a deal because there’s so much on the market.

_Adam_: And getting a place of my own is, well, financially out of the question. But quite a few people on our street are moving out, right?

_Juliet_: Yeah, like my sister’s moving again. She wants to be more in the centre.

_Adam_: Oh, OK.

**_Extract Two_**

_Halim_: Hi, Soraya, how are you getting on with your essay on plastic?

_Soraya_: Hi, Halim. Well, the background reading’s fascinating. OK, there’s been a complete U-turn in the views expressed in journals and even in the popular press in recent years. But actually, when I read about the 1950s, I get that at that time plastic was seen as revolutionary. You could make anything from it, from bottles to roofs; it was so strong and durable. What was not to like? Whereas now, it’s seen as a real threat to the planet.

_Halim_: Yeah. I’ve read a couple of really thought-provoking articles and I watched the documentary our tutor recommended, you know the one called _Plastic Madness_.

_Soraya_: Oh yeah, any good?

_Halim_: Wildly over-dramatic at the end, in my view. To be fair, it did go into the pros and cons of the uses of plastic, and it covered the main ideas we’d discussed in class, but _to close with statements like Most species of fish will be extinct within ten years was way over the top_.

_Soraya_: And did it go into issues like plastic causing air pollution?

_Halim_: It did, yeah.

**_Extract Three_**

_Ed_: So, Jane, I’m the parent of a sixteen-year-old, Max, and my wife and I are constantly wondering if we’re doing the right thing.

_Jane_: The teenage years are critical in human development, Ed. Parents are programmed to care for their child, but in evolutionary terms, the infant must develop, mature and eventually separate from them. And although the majority of parents cope admirably with their child becoming a monosyllabic and at times diﬀicult teenager, few know when to let go. At the same time, parents do generally adapt well to having to provide more emotional support than physical support.

_Ed_: With Max, we’re going through things like, he seems reluctant to wake up before ten.

_Jane_: Some schools have changed their timetable to take into account the fact that teenagers perform better later in the day.

_Ed_: Not his, unfortunately. The good thing is Max and I are both seriously into gaming and I’m fascinated by how so many games promote universal values like hard work pays oﬀ, collaboration works better than confrontation and thinking things through is to be admired. I encourage Max to invite his mates round to our house because I want him to build up a circle of good friends who share common interests.
