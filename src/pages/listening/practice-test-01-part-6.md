Tapescript
----------

**Fiona Doyle:** My parents now both work from home so they made the decision to move from our city-centre flat to the countryside, although it meant big changes for the whole family. It was a winter evening when we first went to the village, and as we walked along the pavement __I remarked on how dark it was without the street lights of the city, and how bright that made the lights of the cars seem__ **\[9\]** as they approached. I also noticed the sound of running water, and when we reached the house I was delighted to discover that it stood next to a little bridge over a stream. I soon decided I liked the house. It has thick stone walls, high ceilings and wooden floors. The central heating keeps the temperature in all the rooms pleasant throughout the year, although __during the colder months those in the basement tend to get a bit damp__ **\[10\]**, probably because of the stream. My room is actually on the other side of the house so I don’t hear it at night, which is a pity, really. I was used to the constant big-city background noise of traffic and voices, and __for a while after we moved in I’d keep waking up in the middle of the night owing to the total silence there__ **\[11\]**. It doesn’t bother me now, though, and these days I look forward to settling down for the night in my large, comfortable bed. I rarely stay up any later than when I was in the flat, and __in the mornings I normally wake up at the same time, but there aren’t the sounds of the city telling you it’s time to get up so I’m usually in far less of a hurry to do so__ **\[12\]**. The atmosphere here is so relaxing, and I have a wonderful view from the window of my room. Whereas before I’d see city wildlife like cats, dogs and maybe the occasional fox, __here I start the day to the sound of distant farm animals and the sight of rabbits in the open fields__ **\[13\]**. Apparently there are also deer around, though I haven’t actually spotted any yet. The pace of life in the countryside is certainly slower, but I think I’ve adjusted pretty well to it. I must confess, though, that __I can get a bit fed up with the speed of the Internet connection here__ **\[14\]**, compared with how fast it was in the flat downtown. In spite of that I still manage to chat online with my friends there more or less whenever I want, so I don’t have the feeling of missing them that I thought I might have before I moved. __There is, though, fairly weak mobile reception out here – sometimes no signal at all – and when that happens I may not receive calls they’re trying to make to me__ **\[15\]**, which can be annoying. I suppose poor public transport is another disadvantage of living in the country. There isn’t a railway station within five kilometres, __it’s nearly a two-kilometre walk to get to a bus stop__ **\[16\]**, and taxis charge a fortune to come out here. It’s so different from where I grew up, where the buses stop right outside your home or you can take the Underground.

__You can live quite happily there without a car, but not here__ **\[17\]**. People say ‘why not go by bike?’, but the reality is that it’s just too far to ride anywhere from here – and dangerous on those country roads, especially in the dark. I’ll just have to rely on my parents for lifts everywhere until I pass my driving test, which I hope will be before __I go to university next year. Fortunately, it’ll be a shorter drive from here than from where I used to live__ **\[18\]**, and I’ll avoid the awful traffic on the roads in and out of the city, too!
