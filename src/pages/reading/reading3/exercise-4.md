**Rock the Boat**  
**Q1**  
The boats, or 'Oppies' as they are affectionately called, were lying bottom-up on the beach, their sails tightly wrapped beside them. There's been a delay, the race organizer said, pointing at two flags waving in the breeze. He said the red-and white-striped one meant that there was a lay while the red, white and blue one meant it would be for three hours.  
**Q2  
**No one looks disappointed, probably because they are accustomed to being ruled by the weather. Competitors - casually dressed in baggy chorts, T-shirts, deck shoes and an assortment of anoraks and baseball caps -played on bikes or skateboards or just chatted to kill the time. Spectators sat in groups in the clubhouse, eating rolls and drinking tea.  
**Q3**  
I suddenly felt very pale and indoorsy' as I sat down with some of the tanned, blond champs. Nicky Barnes, 15, Elliot Willis, 14, Eddie Huntley, 13, and Paul Campbell Jones, 14, have been sailing for years, and certainly have the sea in their blood. Paul's dad sailed in the Olympics and Nicky started sailing because her dad dragged her along. was terrified at first,' she confesses. Recently they successfully competed at the world  
championships.  
**Q4**  
Varying degrees of hard work go into their preparation, but Nicky does the most. She trains in winter and says it is hard, 'especially when all your friends are out partyingâ€œ. Then she practices techniques, boat handling and wind strategy. Meanwhile, Elliot had learned how the shape of clouds and hills affects the wind. Eddie is more relaxed and a bit more confident about it: I don't like training. lve got better things to do.'  
**Q5**  
They all get on well, joking and teasing each other, but out on the wa ter, competition is fierce. Paul doesn't hesitate to say the best thing about sailing is winning. They've all had nasty moments, but no one will admit to falling in. The boys happily told me of Micky's fear of fish, and Elliot tells a good tale about his boat being hit by a shark.  
**Q6**  
Other sports, they stressed, tend to take second place: Elliot could play cricket for his area but doesn't, and Nicky plays hockey, 'but l'm not allowed to do it before big events'. The comments of their non-sailing friends about their bootie lifestyles ranged from 'a bit weird' to 'really cool'. Elliot thinks that only people who are jealous want to make fun of them.
