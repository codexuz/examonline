**Q1**  
Max Factor is often called the father of modern make-up. The success story started in Max's early years. He was born Max Faktorowicz in Lodz Poland, near the Russian border, around 1877. With 10 children, his parents could not afford formal education for their children, so at the age of eight Max was placed in an apprenticeship to a pharmacist. Years of mixing potions for the pharmacy developed his fascination with cosmetics.  
**Q2**  
Eventually, Max opened his own shop in a suburb of Moscow, selling hand-made cosmetics. "Health and beauty products" became an important business for him. A traveling theatrical troupe bought and wore Max's make-up and wigs while performing for Russian nobility. Soon Max became the official cosmetic expert for members of the Russian court, the Imperia! Grand Opera and the Ballet.  
**Q3**  
In 1904, Max and his family moved to the United States. Max Faktorowicz was now Max Factor, the name given to him at Ellis Island by immigration officials. Now Max Factor was dreaming of movie actors and actresses using his products. He moved his family to Los Angeles. In 1914, Max Factor created a make-up specifically for movie actors that, unlike thick theatrical make-up, would not crack.  
**Q4**  
The development of color film production required the Max Factor company to develop a new line of products. The existing make-up reflected surrounding colors. As a result of how bad they looked, many actors and actresses refused to appear in color films. At this time Frank Factor, Max's son, took the lead and developed a suitable product. It had a solid cake form and was applied with a damp sponge, which concealed skin imperfections  
**Q5**  
Soon actresses and other women working on movies sets were stealing new makeup to use in their personal lives. Its only disadvantage for every days use was that it made the skin too dark under regular lights, having been designed for the powerful lights used in film studios. Frank Factor began developing lighter shades. In 1937, new "Pan-Cake" make-up was released the public and it became one of the fastest selling cosmetic items.  
**Q6**  
After Max Factor's death, Frank Factor took the name Max Factor, Jr., and expanded the still private cosmetics firm. The company began development of a smear-proof lipstick which would not fade. A special machine was constructed to test the formula's resistance. The result was "Tru-Color" lip stick in six shades of red. During World War ll, Max Factor developed make up shades for use by the US Marine Corps in camouflaging faces.
