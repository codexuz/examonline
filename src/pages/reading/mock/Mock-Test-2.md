It is believed that the virus was transmitted from (1)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to humans. Some of the first cases were diagnosed in people who had visited a market selling live seafood and animals. Unfortunately, when viruses are (2)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ from animals to people, it can take scientists a lot of time before they can develop a vaccine or medicines to cure it.

 Some of the (3)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  of the coronavirus are fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, headache, and trouble breathing. These symptoms are very much like those people have with a cold or the flu. The virus can be more serious in some people, especially if they are sick or have health problems.
While it is early to have a definite picture of the disease because (4)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are still collecting the data, some
patterns have already emerged among children. Some early reports reveal that (5)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ seem to be getting coronavirus at much lower rates than adults. Even if they (6)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ infected, the symptoms are milder. However, most people who get severely infected are those with a weak immune system, like the elderly.
