Part 1

Read the text. Fill in each gap with ONE word. You must use a word which is somewhere in the rest of the text.

Do Whales Sleep? Whales are (1)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ which means they feed their young with milk. So in many ways, they are just like human beings. The most important difference is that humans and whales live in different environments and whales have a special respiratory system that enables them to stay (2)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for several minutes without breathing oxygen. For this reason, they are said to be voluntary breathers. That is, because of whales underwater environment, they must be conscious breathers. They think about every breath they take and come up to the surface of the water to breathe through blow holes on top of their heads.

What is outstanding about whales is the way they can sleep. While all mammals sleep, (3)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cannot afford to become unconscious for long because they may drown. The only way they can (4)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is by remaining partially conscious. It is believed that only one hemisphere of the whale's brain sleeps at a time, so they rest but are never completely asleep. They can do so most probably near the (5)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the water so that they can come up for air easily.

Communicating Styles and Conflict

Q1

AS far back as Hippocrates' time (460-370B.C.), people have tried to understand other people by characterizing them according to personality type or temperament. Hippocrates believed there were four different hos fluids that influenced four basic types of temperament. His work was further developed 500 years later by Galen. These days there are any number of self-assessment tools that relate to the basic descriptions developed hu Galen, although we no longer believe the source to be the types of body fluid that dominate our systems.

Q2

The values in self-assessments that help determine personality style. Learning styles, communication styles, conflict-handling styles, or other aspects of individuals is that they help depersonalize conflict in interpersonal relationships. The depersonalization occurs when you realize that others aren't trying to be difficult, but they need different or more information than you do. They're not intending to be rude: they are so focused on the task they forget about greeting people. They would like to work faster but not at the risk of damaging the relationships needed to get the job done. They understand there is a job to do. But it can only be done right with the appropriate information, which takes time to collect. When used appropriately, understanding communication styles can help resolve conflict on teams. Very rarely are conflicts true personality issues. Usually they are issues of style, information needs, or focus.

Q3

Hippocrates and later Galen determined there were four basic temperaments: sanguine, phlegmatic, melancholic and choleric. These descriptions were developed centuries ago and are still somewhat apt, although you could update the wording. In today's world, they translate into the four fairly common communication styles described below:

Q4

The sanguine person would be the expressive or spirited style 0T communication. These people speak in pictures. They invest a lot or emotion and energy in their communication and often speak quickly. Putting their whole body into it. They are easily sidetracked onto a story that may or may not illustrate the point they are trying to make. Because of their enthusiasm, they are great team motivators. They are concerned about people and relationships. Their high levels of energy can come on strong at times and their focus is usually on the bigger picture, which means they sometimes s miss the details or the proper order of things. These people find conflict or differences of opinion invigorating and love to engage in a spirited discussion. They love change and are constantly looking for new and exciting adventures.

Q5

Tile phlegmatic person-cool and persevering - translates into the technical or systematic communication style. This style of communication is focused on facts and technical details. Phlegmatic people have an orderly methodical way of approaching tasks, and their focus is very much on the task, not on the people, emotions, or concerns that the task may evoke. The focus is also more on the details necessary to accomplish a task. Sometimes the details overwhelm the big picture and focus needs to be brought back to the context of the task. People with this style think the facts should speak for themselves, and they are not as comfortable with conflict. They need time to adapt to change and need to understand both the logic of it and the steps involved.

Q6

Tile melancholic person who is soft hearted and oriented toward doing things for others translates into the considerate or sympathetic communication style. A person with this communication style is focused on people and relationships. They are good listeners and do things for other people-Sometimes to the detriment of getting things done for themselves. They want to solicit everyone's opinion and make sure everyone is comfortable with whatever is required to get the job done. At times this focus on others can distract from the task at hand. Because they are so concerned with the needs of others and smoothing over issues, they do not like conflict. They believe that change threatens the status quo and tends to make people feel uneasy, so people with this communication style, like phlegmatic people, need time to consider the changes in order to adapt to them.

USA: Still looking for Gold

There are still prospectors searching for gold in the American Far West GOLD has always attracted people. At the start of the twentieth century. and during the nineteenth century, thousands of men went to the West of the United States, looking for gold. The "Gold Rush" lasted, on and off, for sixty or seventy years, then it finished.

But today, there are still men and women out in the West, looking for gold, as Andrew Rossiter found out.

It was a blistering hot day in summer. The track leading to "Atlantic City" (Wyoming) was dry and bumpy, and great clouds of dust blew up behind the car. In 1870, Atlantic City was a prosperous town, with several thousand inhabitants, mostly men. It was a strange place to find a town, mind you, hidden in little gulch in the middle of a wide scrub desert.

Atlantic City began life as a staging post on one of the transcontinental trails, taken by emigrants an route for California. Soon however it became d roaring gold town, where people could make (or lose) their fortunes in a day. Few did make a fortune; many found enough gold to keep them happy but a lot found nothing, or nothing much.

Then, about seven years after the gold rush began, it finished. Suddenly, it seemed that there was no gold left in the ground. The miners packed their tools, their pans, and their bags, and went off somewhere else, to try their luck again. There were no more emigrants either; as soon as the first transcontinental railroad had opened in 1869, the old emigrant trails had been completely abandoned. The hotels closed, the shops closed, the bars closed, the jail closed; and before long, Atlantic City was a ghost town, un inhabited except by the occasional rancher or hunter, and the wandering coyotes. I didn't expect to find much in Atlantic City. I knew that a few people lived there again now, some of the old houses had been restored, and others had been built. But l didn't expect much.

We drove round a dusty bend, and there in front of us lay the town, a couple of dozen wooden buildings, some old, some new, and mostly pretty plain.

Surprisingly there was a fire-station; then, in the middle of the town, a wooden "saloon". A drink, I thought, something to drink at last.

I stopped the car in a cloud of dust, and we walked up the steps and into the saloon. I saw an old man called Brad. Brad hadn't spent all his life digging in tunnels and panning in streams, to find a few ounces of gold. In fact, he was a retired businessman, looking for gold as a hobby, and a nice way to pass the time in a wild, lonely and beautiful part of North America.

More than gold, no doubt, Brad was looking for a way of life, a dream of the past. If he had found no gold, he would not have been too worried. Few of today's amateur gold prospectors are there for the money; they're there for the fun, the isolation, and the nostalgia!. The legend of the west will go on inspiring people for many many years.

Part 5

Read the following text for questions 1-6.

How to spot a liar

However much we may abhor it, deception comes naturally to all living things. Birds do it by feigning injury to lead hungry predators away from nesting young. Spider crabs do it by disguise: adorning themselves with strips of kelp and other debris, they pretend to be something they are not - and so escape their enemies. Nature amply rewards successful deceivers by allowing them to survive long enough to mate and reproduce. So it may come as no surprise to learn that human beings- who, according to psychologist Gerald Johnson of the University of South California, or lied to about 200 times a day, roughly one untruth every 5 minutes- often deceive for exactly the same reasons: to save their own skins or to get something they can't get by other means.

But knowing how to catch deceit can be just as important a survival skill as knowing how to tell a lie and get away with it. A person able to spot falsehood quickly is unlikely to be swindled by an unscrupulous business associate or hoodwinked by a devious spouse. Luckily, nature provides more than enough clues to trap dissemblers in their own tangled webs if you know where to look. By closely observing facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, practically anyone can recognise the tell-tale signs of lying. Researchers are even programming computers - like those used on Lie Detector - to get at the truth by analysing the same physicals available to the naked eye and ear. "With the proper training, many ne0ple can learn to reliably detect lies," says Paul Ekman, professor of psychology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has spent the past 15 years studying the secret art of deception.

In order to know what kind of lies work best, successful liars need to accurately assess other people's emotional states. Ackman's research shows that this same emotional intelligence is essential for good lie detectors, too. The emotional state to watch out for is stress, the conflict most liars feel between the truth and what they actually say and do.

Even high-tech lie detectors don't detect lies as such; they merely detect the physical cues of emotions, which may or may not correspond to what the person being tested is saying. Polygraphs, for instance, measure respiration, heart rate, and skin conductivity, which tend to increase when people are nervous as they usually are when lying. Nervous people typically perspire, and the salts contained in perspiration conduct electricity. That's why sudden leap in skin conductivity indicates nervousness - about getting caught, perhaps - which makes, in turn, suggest that someone is being economical with the truth. On the other hand, it might also mean that the lights in the television Studio are too hot- which is one reason polygraph tests are inadmissible in court. "Good lie detectors don't rely on a single thing," says Ekma, but interprets clusters of verbal and non-verbal clues that suggest someone might be lying."

The clues are written all over the face. Because the musculature of the face directly connected to the areas of the brain that processes emotion, the countenance can be a window to the soul. Neurological studies even suggest that genuine emotions travel different pathways through the brain than insincere ones. If a patient paralyzed by stroke on one side of the face, for example, is asked to smile deliberately, only the mobile side of the mouth is raised. But tell that same person a funny joke, and the patient breaks into a full and spontaneous smile. Very few people -most notably. actors and politicians are able to consciously control all of their facial expressions. Lies can often be caught when the liars' true feelings briefly leak through the mask of deception. We don't think before we feel, Ekman says. "Expressions tend to show up on the face before we're even conscious of experiencing an emotion."

For questions 1-4, fill in the missing information in the numbered spaces.

Write no more than ONE WORD and / or A NUMBER for each question.
