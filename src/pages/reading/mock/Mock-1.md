# Part 3

Read the text and choose the correct heading for each paragraph from the list of headings below.

There are more headings than paragraphs, so you will not use all of them. You cannot use any heading more than once. Mark your answers on the answer sheet.

A) Vandalism

B) Comfortable furniture

C) Expression of feelings

D) Missing teenager

E) Teenage addict

F) Graffiti artist

G) Judging by appearances

H) Teenager's room

Q1

For many young people aerosol art is just as serious as wall painting was for their prehistoric ancestors. Graffiti is very personal to the teenager who produces it. The motivation behind a piece of graffiti can be happiness or sadness, frustration or relief. For some artists, graffiti is a reaction to what happens in their lives. For this reason, it is an art form that is very close to the hearts of the young.

Q2

l am allowed to do what I like with it. I don't have a lot of space, but it is my favourite place, so I spend a lot of time there. I am the youngest in the family so I also have a lot of old toys on the shelves. I sometimes get bored h the way it is and when l do I change it round. I often move the bed and chaange the posters on the walls. I've asked my parents for a television but I don't think l'd get one.

Q3

I have been playing video games since I was ten. I am now fifteen and I can't get rid of my habit. These days I play for about twenty-five hours a week. Playing video games stops me from exercising and playing basketball and I have no time for friends. Many of the games are very violent but I don't take them seriously. They are just fun. I think the main problem with games is that they are too much fun.

Q4

First impressions are vital. For many employers, neat and tidy hair and smart clothes are as important as qualifications. What factors contribute that vital first impression? It varies a lot according to our culture. For example, in the United States tall people are considered more reliable and serious in business. In many cultures physically attractive people are thought of as warmer, kinder, more sociable and even more intelligent.

Q5

Dean Palmer is fourteen years old. He may also use the names Dick Page or Daryl Preston. He has short fair hair and is of medium height and slim build. He wears glasses. He was last seen wearing jeans, a brown leather jacket and black trainers. If he is at your school, or has ever been admitted into the school, please telephone the police immediately.

Q6

I'm known as Chase. That's my tag. When started I would go out at night with a few friends and just painted football slogans and things like that on any wall l could find I suppose it was a way of making a statement. Eventually l got caught. I still continue to express my feelings with the help aerosol painting, but these days I get permission first.

A losing battle

Not every beautiful plant growing in your garden or in the countryside is a welcome sight. We are not talking about normal weeds - plants which are not wanted, but can be removed with a bit of hard work. This article features another category: species, often from overseas, that grow where they do not belong and are dangerous for humans and even buildings. These non-native plants invade new areas, spread rapidly and are difficult to remove. As a result, they are called non-native invasive plants. Not growing in their home country, the problem with many of these plants is that they often have no natural enemies to keep them under control.

A good example of non-native invasive plants is Japanese knotweed. The World Conservation Union lists this plant as one of the world's worst invasive species, because it can grow through hard surfaces, such as roads and walls. In the UK, it is already causing massive damage to roads and affecting property values. Japanese knotweed originally came from Asia and grows naturally on the sides of volcanoes, where volcanic ash keeps it from spreading. It was introduced to the West by the botanist Philippe von Sie bold, who sent it to the Royal Botanical Gardens Kew in August 1850 in a parcel of plants. The attractive plant, which reaches a height of three to four metres, was much admired and quickly became very popular with the Victorians. Garden centres sold it commercially and it was deliberately planted all over the UK. Since 1981 it has been a crime to plant or grow Japanese knotweed in the wild. This includes moving polluted soil or plant cuttings. If you are caught doing so, you can be fined or even sent to prison for up to two years.

It is not illegal to have this plant on your property, but you as the landowner have the legal responsibility to ensure that it does not spread to your neighbours' land. Anyone wishing to sell a house with Japanese knotweed within seven metres of their property has a problem. Many banks will refuse to give potential buyers a loan and insurance companies will not bear the cost of damage caused by this plant. Additionally, neighbours could take legal action because their properties are also in danger indirectly. Japanese knotweed is incredibly difficult and expensive to remove. It grows very quickly and aggressively, with roots three metres deep and seven metres across. You can try and dig it out yourself, but because it spreads underground, it is almost impossible to ensure all the roots have been removed. Consequently, the plant will soon appear again. Also. this plant is classified as special waste. so you have to take it to a place that has permission to dispose of it, which may mean you have to nav a huge fee. Alternatively, the plant can be treated with a chemical Weed killer. This takes about three years to be effective and is slightly cheaper than removing it manually. Considering the seriousness of the situation, professional help is the most effective and sensible way to solve the problem.

Another invasive species is the giant hogweed which comes from Central Asia. It was first introduced to European gardens in the middle of the 19th century because of its impressive white flowers which are grouped together on umbrella like heads. It can have a height of up to five metres and grows at riversides and anywhere else where the soil is moist. The problem with this plant is the liquid inside it, known as the sap. If you come into contact with it, and are then exposed to sunlight, you will receive blistering burns that sometimes stay for several weeks and may well leave a scar. If you touch this plant, clean the skin area with lots of Soap and water and then consult a doctor. The problem is that a victim, not being aware of the danger, does not notice anything is wrong until a few days later. And the biggest issue with this plant is that children are tempted to play with it due to its large leaves and exciting hollow stalks. There have been many cases of hospitalisation. These are just two examples, but they have something in common. They started their invasion as a beautiful plant specimen brought home from a far-away country without anyone being aware of the consequences of this action. Due to today's globalisation, we have a new responsibility: to protect location-specific environments and not move native plants from country to country.

Jumping spiders

\_ Peter Aldhons examines how Portia spiders catch their prey. \_

For a stalking predator, the element of surprise is crucial. And for jumping spiders that sneak onto other spiders' webs to prey on their owners.it can be the difference between having lunch and becoming it. Now zoologists have discovered the secret of these spiders' tactics: creeping forward when their prey's web is vibrating.

The fifteen known species of Portia jumping spiders are relatively small. with adults being about two centimeters long (that's smaller than the cap on most pens). They habitually stay in the webs of other spiders, and in an area of these webs that is as out-of-the-way as possible. Portia spiders live mostly in tropical forests, where the climate is hot and humid. They hunt a range of other spiders, some of which could easily turn the tables on them. They will attack something about twice their own size if they are really hungry,' says Stimson Wilcox of Binghamton University in New York State. Wilcox and his colleague, Kristen Gentile of the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, wanted to find out how Portia spiders keep the upper hand.

The researchers allowed various prey spiders to spin webs in the laboratory and then introduced Portia spiders. To simulate the shaking effect of a breeze the zoologists used either a model aircraft propeller or attached a tiny magnet to the centre of the web which could be vibrated by applying a varying electrical field. The researchers noticed that the stalking Portia spiders moved more when the webs were shaking than when they were stilt and they were more likely to capture their prey during tests in which the webs were penorncally shaken than in those where the webs were undisturbed. If the spiders were placed onto unoccupied webs, they would make no attempt to change their movements.

It is the Portia spider's tactic of making its victims' webs shake that has most intrigued the researchers, They noticed that the spiders would some times shake their quarry's web violently, then creep forwards up to five millimeters before the vibrations died down. They'd make a big pluck with one of their hind legs,' says Wilcox. These twangs were much more powerful than the gentler vibrations Portia spiders use to mimic a trapped insect, and the researchers were initially surprised that the prey spiders did not respond to them in any way. But they have since discovered that the violent twanging produces a pattern of vibrations that match those caused by a twig falling onto the web.

Other predators make use of natural 'smokescreens' or disguise to hide from their prey: lions hunting at night, for example, move in on their prey when clouds obscure the moon. ʻBut this is the first example of an animal making its own smokescreen that we know of,' says Wilcox. "Portia spiders are clearly intelligent and they often learn from their prey as they are trying to capture it. They do this by making different signals on the web of their prey until the prey spider makes a movement. In general, Portia spiders adjust their stalking strategy according to their prey and what the prey is doing. Thus, Portia spiders use trial-and-error learning in stalking. Sometimes they will even take an indirect route to reach a prey spider they can see from a distance. This can sometimes take one to two hours following a predetermined route. When it does this, the Portia spider is actually solving problems and thinking ahead about its actions.'
