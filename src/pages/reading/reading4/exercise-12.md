**Read the following text for questions 1-9.**

Alan McCormick, 16, lives near Sacramento, California, and has been learning Chinese for two years. "The lessons are interesting because our teacher explains to us what the characters mean and how they become what they are. Sometimes we also watch Chinese movies. The hardest thing Is to write characters and listen to other people speak Mandarin".California has had close ties to China for many years. Since many immigrants came from China originally, the Chinese language has often been passed on by family members. What is interesting is that in the last few years, kids like Alan, who have no direct ties to China, are learning Mandarin a lot earlier and in greater numbers. Currently, more than 100 schools in California ae.  
offering Mandarin classes.  
Spanish has always been the second most important language in many parts of the USA, although German and French are also old favorites. That Mandarin, a much more exotic language, is able to penetrate this stand. ing is due largely to China's increased global presence. Officially, there are more than 80,000 nationals from the People's Republic of China in America, including 27,000 students. But many more ethnic Chinese fromn all over the world live here too. Not surprisingly, interest in all things Chi nese has grown - food, art, fengshui, acupuncture, gongfu, sports. Bruce Lee and Jacky Chan have always held an audience, but now, so do Ang Lee and Zhang Yimou. Chinese film festivals, concerts, and even Chinese disco nights draw American audiences too.  
But it is not easy teaching American kids Mandarin. Many lower second ary schools offer the language as an after school activity much as footbal or music club is offered. So students come from different classes and ages and tend not to meet one another daily. There is also little support at home, unlike Chinese or Chinese-American children who usually attend Chinese schools run by Chinese organisations, and which follow a mainland or Tai wanese curriculum. "We all found that after a little while, Chinese classes \[for American kids\] slowed down and language learners became demoti vated by the increasing number of complicated characters. They needed for a very long time to learn simple questions and answers. Students could not express what they really wanted to express. And, after learning so much, they still could not read interesting stuff," says Lu Wing, a teacher, inter preter and textbook author. The problems are compounded by the lack of staff and of appropriate teaching material. Many schools employ a native Chinese national who may or may not be qualified, and they are not paid very well.  
The Association of Chinese Teachers in America has organised workshops and seminars to exchange ideas and resources. But the training and certification of teachers will continue to be difficult as there is no central authority. Student numbers need to increase significantly before the various state ministries of education will get involved seriously, and students can only be attracted if good teachers exist in the first place. Wing has written a textbook which has become the official learning material for Chinese at upper secondary levels in some states. "I separated the learning of characters from the training of dialogues. This strategy rallowed  
he students to start character learning a bit more systematically, which a itself enhances the possibilities of character training: more characters o remembered in shorter time. On the other hand, without the burden of needing to read and write every single character in a dialogue text, the students were able to get on to more interesting subjects of discussion much earlier than before "  
Wing stresses that young learners need to learn in a fun, interactive way and encourages the use of theatre, songs., games, films, competitions, picture shows and presentations for parents and other students. "And, of course having the possibility to travel to China is one of the most attractive aims for learning the language." When asked about his opinion, Alan responded that he would like to go to China one day, but only for vacations. He may have heard that Chinese children have a much longer school day than kids in America and that they have a lot more tests! The future of Mandarin in Californian schools seems bright. Some schools in various states have incorporated Mandarin into the school curriculum and are offering it as a pre-university subject. Wing's earliest group of students who started as children many years ago still has regular class reunions. Many are now studying the Chinese language at an advanced level or subjects like Asian Business Management at universities. "t is always a pleasure to be invited to their meetings; seeing their progress and success is the most wonderful gift for me as their teacher," says Wing.
