**Read the following text for questions 1-6.**

Sometimes, there is a common cause for apparently different illnesses lake for instance, various kinds of tumors, which are groupings of cells continuously separating. And lately, a spectacular medical theory has developed. It speculates how illnesses of the central nervous system, such as Lou Gehrig's disease, AIDS and rubella , use a similar process of reproduction.  
The theory replaces the idea of continuous re-creation with the idea that the body does not remove its own waste properly. Normally, the cause of these diseases is mishandled plutons. What keeps the system busy is the process of collecting the waste of healthy cells. Carrier cells pick up the waste as they travel through the bloodstream and deposit it in waste depots. Healthy cells create plenty of junk that keep the system busy. The process includes compressing the waste by the means of folding. This can be a lengthy process, and with so many steps, that an error is likely to occur. In such a case. the waste must be removed before it causes damage to any serious degree. In a recent issue of the Pacific Rim Journal of Medicine, Al Chervik of Tokyo Medical School, who helped discover the proteasome 20 years ago, explained the process of the biological waste-disposal system when the brain is infected by a particularly nasty, communicable protein called a pluton. Plutons cause Kluziod-Johan disease (or "wasting disease" in deer) by reorganizing the structure of normal proteins in their own image. Dr Chervik proposes that small groups of plutons penetrate the waste-processing proteasome and cease the cellular garbage disposal. Waste material would remain in the brain, and the accumulating toxins would kill the nerve cells. Experimentations on how plutons disrupt nerve cells have revealed the transformation of the brain into a semi-hard substance. The astonishingly young Janice Laub of Ripon College was successfully able to demonstrate this process by using a Petri dish of mouse nerve cells and an incandescent reading lamp. Her results clearly showed how the cells had been trans  
formed to a waste acid.  
The whole process began with Laub administering a deadly substance to the nerve cells with disease-causing plutons. This caused the cells to de grade quickly and create a loose inner core. The plutons passed through the cells skin, then gathered in bunches and liquidated the centre. She then ad ministered an antidote that isolated the accumulated plutons but left the coll's essential components. The hypothesis was proven as the cell regained the faculties and was able to begin removing waste.  
Living pelicans were used in a separate experiment, and similar results were proven. When the pelicans were infected with plutons, toxins collected in their brains. The toxin was connected to amino acids slated for disposal. However, once the plutons had entered the brain, the garbage managed to remain.  
Laub's results support the hypothesis that brain cells are motivated by plutons to make long latent viruses come back. She further speculated that these viruses might even carry plutons to other nerve cells, spreading the infection and causing even greater damage to other parts of the brain. If that idea proves correct, plutons would provide many answers to tumor creation.

**For questions 1-4, fill in the missing information in the numbered spaces.
