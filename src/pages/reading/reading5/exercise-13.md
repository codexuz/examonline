**The sweet scent of success**  
One of Australia's latest innovation successes Stems from a lenon-scented bath-room cleaner called Shower Power, the formula for whist was concocted in a factory in Yatala, Queensland. In 1995, Tom Quinn an4 John Heron bought a struggling cleaning products business, OzKleen. for 250,000. It was selling 100 different kinds of cleaning products, mainly in bulk. The business was in bad shape, the cleaning formulas were inefec tive and environmentally harsh, and there were few regular clients. Now Shower Power is claimed to be the topselling bathroom cleaning product in the country. In the past 12 months, almost four million bottles of Ozkleen's Power products have been sold and the company forecasts 2004 sales of 10 million bottles. The company's, sales in2003 reached $11 million, with 700k of business being exports. In particular, Shower Power is making big inroads on the British market.  
OzKleen's turnaround began when Quinn and Heron hired an industrial chemist to revitalize the product line. Market research showed that people were looking for a better cleaner for the bathroom, universally regarded as the hardest room in the home to clean. The company also wanted to make the product formulas more environmentally friendly One of Tom Quinn's sons, Peter, aged 24 at the time, began working with the chemist on the formulas, looking at the potential for citrus-based cleaning products. He detested all the chlorine-based cleaning products that dominated the market. "We didn't want to use chlorine, simple as that," he says. "It offers bad working conditions and there's no money in it." Peter looked at citrus ingredients, such as orange peel, to replace the petroleum by-products in cleaners. He is credited with finding the Shower Power formula. "The head," he says. The company is the recipe is in a vault somewhere and in my sole owner of the intellectual property.  
To begin with, Shower Power was sold only in commercial quantities but Tom Quinn decided to sell it in 750ml bottles after the constant "raves" from customers at their retail store at Beenleigh, near Brisbane. Customers were traveling long distances to buy supplies. Others began writing to OzKleen to say how good Shower Power was, "We did a dummy label and went to see Woolworths," Tom Ouinn says. The Woolworths buyer took a bottle home and was able to remove a stain from her basin that had been impossible to shift. From that point on, she championed the product and OzKleen had its first super market order, for a palette or Shower Power worth $3000. "We were over the moon," says 0zKleen's financial controller, Belinda McDonnell.  
Peter Quinn says OzKleen's approach to research and development is open slather. "If I need it, I get it. It is about doing something simple that no one else is doing. Most of these things are just sitting in front of people â€¦ it's just seeing the opportunities." With a tried and tested product, OzKleen is expanding overseas and developing more Power- brand household products. Tom Quinn, who previously ran a real estate agency, says: "We are competing with the same market all over the world, the cleaning products are sold everywhere." Shower Power, known as Bath Power in Britain, was launched four vears ago with the help of an export development grant from the Federal Government. "We wanted to do it straight away because we realized we had the same opportunities worldwide." OzKleen is already number three in the British market, and the next stop is France. The Power range includes cleaning products for carpets, kitchens and pre-wash stain removal. The Quinn and Heron families are still involved. OzKleen has been approached with offers to buy the company, but Tom Quinn says he is happy with things as they are. "We're having too much fun."
