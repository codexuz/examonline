**Read the following text for questions 1-6.**

**Four positive books about the world** **_Factfulness - Hans Rosling with Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Ronnlund_** In Factfulness, Professor Hans Rosling, along with two collaborators,  
asks simple questions about the world. Questions like 'How many girls finish schoo|2' and 'What percentage of the world's population is poor?' It turns out the majority of us get the answers to these questions completely Wrong. Why does this happen? Factfulness sets out to explain why, showing that there are several instincts humans have that distort our perspective.  
For example, most people divide the world into US and THEM. In addition, we often believe that things are getting worse. And we are consuming large amounts of media that use a sales model based on making us afraid But according to the authors, the world isn't as bad as we think, Yes there are real concerns. But we should adopt a mindset of factfulness - only carrying opinions that are supported by strong facts. This book is not concerned with the underlying reasons for poverty or progress, or what should be done about these issues. It focuses on our instinctive biases, offering  
practical advice to help us see the good as well as the bad in the world.  
**_Enlightenment Now- Steven Pinker_**  
Are things getting worse every day? Is progress an impossible goal? In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at the big picture of human progress and finds good news. We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives.  
Pinker asks us to stop paying so much attention to negative headlines and news that declares the end of the world. Instead, he shows us some carefully selected data. In 75 surprising graphs, we see that safety, peace, knowledge and health are getting better all over the world. When the evidence does not support his argument, however, he dismisses it. Economic inequality, he claims, is not really a problem, because it is not actually that important for human well-being. One cannot help wondering how many people actually living in poverty would agree.  
The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of rea son and science are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's tribalism, fatalism and distrust, then we are in danger of causing irreparable damage to important institutions like democracy and world co-operation.  
_**The Rational Optimist - Matt Ridley**_  
For more than two hundred years the pessimists have been winning the public debate. They tell us that things are getting worse. But in fact, life is getting better. Income, food availability and lifespan are rising; dis ease, violence and child mortality are falling. These trends are happening all around the world. Africa is slowly coming out of poverty, just as Asia did before. The internet, mobile phones and worldwide trade are making the lives of millions of people much better. Best-selling author Matt Ridley doesn't only explain how things are get ting better; he gives us reasons why as well. He shows us how human cul ture evolves in a positive direction thanks to the exchange of ideas and spe cialisation. This bold book looks at the entirety of human history -trom tie Stone Age to the 21st century - and changes the notion that it's all going downhill. The glass really is half-full.
