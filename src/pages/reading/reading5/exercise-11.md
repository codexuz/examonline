**Read the following text for questions 1-6.**

California may be in danger of losing its major cities. Several along the Coast were built upon a dangerous section of fault line known for ferocity  
California  
and speed. Some faults can send earthquakes zooming along the ground faster than the speed of sound, scientists say-and California's San Andreae Fault may be one of them. Most earthquake faults "unzip" at around3 kilometers a second. But evidence is growing that some faults can send erthquakee Zooming much faster--up to 6 kilometers a second. "They are moving fast. than the speed of sound, like a sonic boom," said Reah Kapur, a seismologist at Wentworth University in the U.K. These hasty earthquakes cause much more damage on the ground and are more likely to topple buildings. snap bridges, and crinkle highways than regular upheavals. Now it turns out that the San Andreas Fault may be one of these earthquake "superhigh ways." It has takern Kapur nearly 30 years to prove their existence because superfast earthquakes are rare. But on February 12, 2006, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the Khatota coastal region of Madagascar. That quake unzipped over 500 kilometers of fault, providing the long-awaited oppor tunity. Kapur and her colleagues, by studying the seismic activity, have been able to map out the earthquake's trek. "The quake started slowy, but then accelerated to speeds of a super shear-wave speed, traveling for more than 100 kilometers at a speed of nearly 6 kilometers per second," Kapur said. Kapur and colleagues also realized that the fast section of the Madagascar fault happened to be very long and straight, like a true beam. "When a fault has curves and bends in it, then the earthquake slows," Kapur said. “But on a long straightaway, it can reach breakneck speeds." Theo" ries are now abound concerning the reason for the colossal damage causea by California's 1904 earthquake. "Directly beneath San Francisco is a lon8 straight section," Kapur said. Efforts are underway to effectively utilize this information. "Much can be done to ensure buildings can cope witn higher frequencies of a faster wave," said Lacy Underawl, a seismologist at Nebraska State University, who wasn't involved in Kapur's work. "New huildings can be built on balls and located on bedrock rather than soft sed iments," she added. San Francisco isn't the only major city at risk. Further down the San Andreas Fault, another section of "freeway" exists under aoath the Carrizo Plain down to the Baja Peninsula, Kapur and colleagues cav. "As an earthquake moves along this section it is likely to send out shock aves in front, which may focus on cities like Modesto, Santa Cruz, and Los Angeles, some of the most densely populated parts of California," Kapur said. In a presentation to the National Academy of Subterranean Associ ates, Kapur outlined the need to classify all the world's fissures according to their probable earthquake speed. She believes that communities can be better prepared if faults are better categorized.
