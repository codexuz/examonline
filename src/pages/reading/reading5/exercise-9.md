**Read the following text for questions 1-6.**

**Giving and receiving feedback  
**Your manager stops you and says she needs to have a word about vour performance in the recent project. You worry about it all weekend, won dering what you might have done wrong. When you step into her office on Monday morning she begins by praising you for the good work you've done on the project, and you wonder if this is the obligatory praise that starte off the typical 'feedback sandwich'. You know how the feedback sandwich goes: say something nice, say what you really want to say, say something nice again.  
In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many man agers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive com ments. However, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. Instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be deliv ered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance. Below are three tips to help you make positive feedback count.  
**_1\. Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback_** When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand. the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation  
to offer constructive criticism.  
**_2\. Cultivate a 'growth mindset'_**  
Psychologist and 'growth mindset' proponent Carol Dweck spoke of the plasticity of the brain and our ability to develop skills and talents that we might not have been good at to start with. Many of us tend to focus our praise on the end result and seemingly innate talents, e.g. 'You really have an eye for details' or You have a real talent for organising events'. However, research suggests that by focusing on the process of how things are done - praising effort, experimentation and problem-solving strategies - we can encourage the development of new skills and the continued honing of talents.  
**_3\. Create a culture of offering positive feedback_**  
Make giving positive feedback part of your team/department/company culture. Don'tjust wait for special moments like appraisals to give feedback. Offer informal positive feedback when making small talk or when walkin8 down a corridor. Feedback doesn't have to only come from the higher ranks either. Encourage peer feedback among team members and colleague and actively ask them for positive comments on each other's performances on tasks. It might take time to counter the effects of an environment where there is a cynical view of positive feedback, but in the long run, by embracing nositive feedback, you can not only enhance working performance but also enrich the quality of life in the workplace.

**For questions 1-4, fill in the missing information in the numbered spaces.  
_Write no more than ONE WORD and / or A NUMBER for each question._**  
Managers often use the strategy of **(1)**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ negative feedback after and before positive comments, which results in decreasing the value of positive comments.  
Dweck claims that it is more important to pay much attention to the **(2)**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of successful works done by employees rather than focusing on the  
final result.  
It is advised not to wait for special occasions for giving positive feedback since it is possible to give positive feedback frequently, which is actually **(3)**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
Although people still have **(4)**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ perspectives towards positive feedback, this will not last long since it improves work efficiency.
