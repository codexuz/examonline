**THE FUTURE OF JOURNALISM**  
It is not only on sites like Facebook and Twitter that amateur journalism is on the rise. There are now open publishing sites, such as the Independent Media Center or "Indymedia', which aim to bringa 'grassroots dimension' into the news arena. Ohmynews, one of South Korea's most influential on line sources for the latest in current affairs, has 2 million readers every day and a nationwide army of 26,000 Ê»citizen' journalists. More and more of ten these citizen journalists and open sites are getting the scoop on major stories. The first mention of the problems facing the doomed space shuttle Columbia appeared on an online discussion forum 11 minutes before the As sociated Press broke the news. What is more, there has been a fundamen tal change in how we interact with the news. Nowadays, with the growth in online versions of newspapers, the public can easily comment, point out er rors, and share alternative viewpoints. These opportunities are particularly vital if you find yourself the subject of a news story - whether for positive or negative reasons. If the story involves you, you can provide vital context and supplementary information which can change readers' views on your story. When this trend for participatory media was in its infancy, there was plenty of mistrust of amateur journalists' who lacked the credentials of JOurnalists working in established media outlets. If a story didn't come from Well-known news organizations like CNN or The Times, it wasn't taken seri Ously. Now that perception is changing. Trust in alternative media sources is growing. In fact, mainstream media now regularly recruit members of their own staff from the ranks of amateur news bloggers. Simultaneously, there has been a general shift away from a 'broadcast model', in which the feu broadcast to the many, towards a more inclusive model in which the audi. ence can play an active role. The traditional filter then publish' news modal has been replaced by 'publish then filter', with millions of keen amateure involved at all stages of the process.Of course, like anything else, partici patory journalism has its critics and in particular there are those who claim that newS reporting on social media is used to manipulate people and even spread misinformation or 'fake news'. Whilst this is no doubt true in some cases, it is a sweeping generalization. For example, during the 2011 Lon don riots, it was widely reported on mainstream media that the rioters and looters used social media to spread news about what was happening and to incite others towards violence and protest. However, what is interesting is that the event has now been studied in detail and it has been revealed that this was not the case. In actual fact, citizen journalists played a positive role as the situation unfurled. They were the first to alert the authorities to early incidents of rioting taking place, and helped the police identify offenders by photographing them in the act and sharing the photos on social media. Without ordinary Londoners responding to news in this way, many of the perpetrators would most likely have escaped justice.
