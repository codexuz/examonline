This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I&rsquo;m Neil.</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br />And I&rsquo;m Beth.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br />If you&#39;ve ever tried growing vegetables, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s not easy. They need water, soil, and plenty of sunlight. Plus you have to keep away weeds and insects.</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br />But in some countries, female farmers face a different problem growing and selling vegetables -&nbsp;<strong>sexism</strong>, the mistreatment of one sex based on the belief that the other is better, usually that men are better than women. According to the United Nations, over 40% of farmers globally are women, a number which rises to almost 50% in lower and middle-income countries. Although these women manage farms, look after crops, and sell their produce at market, female farmers face sexism in societies where women are expected to raise children and stay at home.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br />In this programme, we&rsquo;ll be digging into ideas helping female farmers in Bangladesh and Peru to earn a fair price for the food they grow. And, as usual, you&rsquo;ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well. But first I have a question for you, Beth. According to the UN&rsquo;s World Food Programme, or WFP, what is the world&rsquo;s most popular vegetable? Is it:</p><p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; onions?<br />b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tomatoes? or,<br />c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; peppers?</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br />I think the answer is tomatoes.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br />OK, Beth, I&rsquo;ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Poppy farms a small garden in rural Bangladesh where she grows cucumbers, spinach and okra. Although around half of Bangladeshi farmers are female, they&rsquo;re not always welcome at the marketplace, where they face harassment, or are underpaid for their produce.</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br />Now Poppy has joined hundreds of other female farmers using a new online app. The e-commerce platform is called &lsquo;Farm to Go&rsquo; and farmers can sell their produce without revealing their identity, thereby getting a fairer price than at the market. Here&rsquo;s Poppy telling more to, Salman Saeed, reporter for BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World:</p><p><strong>Poppy</strong><br />By selling here, we get more profit. For example, if we sell a product in the market at 30 Taka, we can sell it here at 32 or 33 Taka. That&#39;s what makes us very happy! It also saves time, as after selling the products, we can come home and spend time with the family and can also work in the vegetable garden.</p><p><strong>Salman Saeed</strong><br /> 33 Taka is about 30 US cents, with 300 women currently using the app in Bangladesh. And while the three cents extra might sound small, over the course of the year, as prices&nbsp;<strong>fluctuate&nbsp;</strong>the WFP say the average monthly revenue for each farmer using the app has&nbsp;<strong>risen dramatically.</strong>&nbsp;In the long run, the hope is that it will also be possible to challenge and change attitudes around gender, but in the meantime the extra money she makes per sale&nbsp;<strong>makes a big difference</strong>&nbsp;to Poppy and her family.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Although the app only increases Poppy&rsquo;s profits a little, they soon add up because vegetable prices&nbsp;<strong>fluctuate</strong>, they continually change, moving up and down. According to the WFP, the incomes of farmers using the app have&nbsp;<strong>risen dramatically</strong>, they have increased suddenly and&nbsp; surprisingly.</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br />That&nbsp;<strong>makes a big difference&nbsp;</strong>to Poppy. To<strong>&nbsp;make a big difference</strong>&nbsp;is an idiom meaning to significantly improve a situation. It&rsquo;s good news for female farmers in Bangladesh, but problems continue in many other places, often because it&rsquo;s the man in the family who controls the household finances.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Here, reporter Craig Langran, explains a finance scheme helping female coffee growers in Peru to BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World:</p> <p><strong>Craig Langran</strong><br /> So, I came across a project in Peru recently, and they&#39;re helping female coffee growers to access finance. So how it works - it&#39;s a type of&nbsp;<strong>savings and credit union</strong>&nbsp;and people living nearby can each&nbsp;<strong>chip in</strong>&nbsp;a small amount of money which can then be accessed by a farmer if she needs a loan to, say, buy a new bean processing machine or something like that&hellip;</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br /> Female farmers in Peru have started a&nbsp;<strong>savings and credit union.</strong>&nbsp;This is a kind of cooperative bank where members pool their savings together so they can lend funds to each other. Each member&nbsp;<strong>chips in</strong>, everyone gives a small amount of money to pay for something together.</p> <p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> Getting back to vegetables, I think it&rsquo;s time to reveal the answer to my question, Beth: according to the UN, what is the world&rsquo;s most popular vegetable?</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br />I guessed it was tomatoes&hellip;</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br />Which was&hellip; the correct answer! Technically a fruit, nutritionists count tomato as a vegetable, in fact the most commonly used vegetable in the world. OK, let&rsquo;s recap the vocabulary we&#39;ve learned in this programme on female farmers battling&nbsp;<strong>sexism</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; that&rsquo;s the mistreatment of one sex based on the belief that the other one is better, usually that men are better than women.</p><p><strong>Beth</strong><br /> If something&nbsp;<strong>fluctuates</strong>, it keeps changing, moving up and down.</p><p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> <strong>To rise dramatically&nbsp;</strong>means to increase in a sudden and surprising way.</p> <p><strong>Beth</strong><br /> The idiom to&nbsp;<strong>make a big difference&nbsp;</strong>means to significantly improve a situation.</p> <p><strong>Neil</strong><br /> A<strong>&nbsp;savings and credit union&nbsp;</strong>is a cooperative bank where members pool their savings together so they can borrow money from each other.</p> <p><strong>Beth</strong><br /> And finally, if you&nbsp;<strong>chip in,&nbsp;</strong>youcontribute some money so a group of you can pay for something together.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>And I’m Georgie. “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” – famous words, but do you know who said them?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Of course - that was Neil Armstrong, the first person to land on the Moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>Right, the Apollo 11 spacecraft landed Neil Armstrong on the Moon on the 20th of July 1969. But in decades after that famous event, interest in returning to the Moon faded away... until now.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Summer 2023 saw the start of a new race for the Moon between Russia’s Luna-25 spacecraft and India’s Chandrayaan-3. Russia’s rocket crashed on landing, but Chandrayaan-3 successfully touched down on the 23rd of August, making India only the fourth country to successfully land on the Moon.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>But why this sudden interest in going back to the Moon? That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>But before we blast off, I have a question for you, Georgie. Everyone knows that Neil Armstrong was the first man on the Moon, and was followed by a second astronaut, Buzz Aldrin. But who was the third Apollo astronaut who flew the command module while his crewmates walked on the Moon? Was it:</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yuri Gagarin?<br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Collins? or,<br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alan Shepard?</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>Hmm, I think it was Michael Collins.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Okay, Georgie, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. In some ways, the current interest in the Moon is really more about the origins of Earth. One theory is that during the early days of the solar system, around 4 billion years ago, another planet crashed into Earth breaking off a part which then formed the Moon. Unlike the Earth’s surface, which is constantly moving, the Moon is completely still, frozen in time to create a perfectly preserved record of what happened at the birth of the solar system. Here’s astronomer, Dr Becky Smethurst, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Science:</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Becky Smethurst<br></strong>…Whereas on the Moon, it’s just this <strong>inert</strong> rock, there's no atmosphere so every single thing that's happened to the Moon in its four-and-a-half billion years’ worth history is still recorded there on it.&nbsp; And so, if anyone's ever seen an image of the far side of the Moon, the side of the Moon that we cannot see from Earth is incredibly <strong>pockmarked</strong>. There are <strong>craters</strong> all over that thing, and so this is <strong>a </strong>really <strong>big deal</strong> when we're thinking about what happened to the early Earth as well, because we think all of the Earth's water came from impacts with comets and asteroids in the very early days of the solar system.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>The rock which makes up the Moon is <strong>inert</strong> – it doesn’t move. It’s also full of <strong>craters </strong>- large holes in the ground caused by something hitting it. The Moon has so many of these craters, it’s described as <strong>pockmarked</strong> – having a surface that’s covered in small marks and scars.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>These craters play an important part in the story. Because the Moon’s surface does not change, finding water there would explain a lot about how water, and therefore life, started on Earth. That’s why Dr Smethurst calls the Moon mission a <strong>big deal</strong>, meaning important or significant.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>That’s right. Astronomers know that comets are full of ice, and think comets brought water to Earth when they crashed into it. Evidence of those crashes has been erased by the constantly moving surfaces on Earth, but not on the Moon. So, comparing water from the Moon with water on Earth could provide scientists with vital information, as Dr Smethurst explained to BBC Radio 4’s, Inside Science:</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Becky Smethurst<br></strong>So they'll be looking essentially to see if it has the same characteristics as water here on Earth, and then we can sort of <strong>trace that back</strong> from sort of the crater history as well to working out what actually happened. How long has it been there for as well. Also, various other minerals that might be there, these very heavy minerals that we know come from comets and asteroids. Again, that would be this sort of <strong>smoking gun</strong> to be like, yes this that's where this water came from and it's likely that Earth’s water came from there as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Scientists can <strong>trace </strong>the existence of water on the Moon <strong>back</strong> to find out what happened on Earth. If you <strong>trace </strong>something <strong>back,</strong> you discover the causes of something by investigating how it developed.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>For this reason, Dr Smethurst says finding water on the Moon would be finding a <strong>smoking gun</strong>, a modern idiom meaning indisputable evidence or proof. We’ve learned a lot about the Moon, but we still don’t know the answer to your question, Neil - who was the third Apollo astronaut on that famous first landing in 1969? I said it was Michael Collins…</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong>Which was… the correct answer! Michael Collins never set foot on the Moon himself, but afterwards said the experience of looking back at Earth from the Apollo spacecraft changed his life forever. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned from our trip to the Moon, starting with <strong>inert</strong>, not moving or unable to move.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>A<strong> crater </strong>is a very large hole in the ground.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>Pockmarked </strong>means marked by small holes and scars.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>If you say something is a<strong> big deal</strong>,it’s important or significant in some way.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil<br></strong><strong>To trace something back</strong> means to discover its causes by examining how it developed.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie<br></strong>And finally, the idiom <strong>a smoking gun</strong> refers to indisputable evidence or conclusive proof of something.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br>And I’m Beth. “Plastic is fantastic!” This phrase was used a lot in the 1950s when mass- produced plastic items started to become part of our everyday lives. The following decades saw a revolution as plastic became the most commonly used material in modern life, found in everything from cars to furniture to packaging. Take a quick look around and you’ll soon see how many everyday items contain plastic.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>But now our love of plastic is being questioned, mostly thanks to climate change and pollution caused by <strong>single-use plastics</strong> – plastic products which are designed to be used just once before being thrown away. 11 million tonnes of plastic waste are dumped into our oceans every year. It’s believed that <strong>single-use plastics</strong> make up 40% of all plastic pollution globally.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br>What’s more, it’s not just land and water being polluted – tiny plastic pieces known as <strong>microbeads</strong> have even been found inside the human body, and can be passed from mother to child through breast milk. And because plastic comes from fossil fuels, the process of making it creates problems at every stage, from burning coal, to transportation, to recycling. In this programme, we’ll be asking: is it time to live without plastic? And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>But first I have a question for you, Beth. One reason why plastic became so popular is that it’s a very flexible material. It can be formed into different shapes, making it useful for keeping food fresh, or holding liquid. Originally, plastic was invented to replace the decreasing supply of natural materials like metal, wood and glass. So which items did plastic first replace? Was it:</p>\n<p>a) snooker balls?<br>b) shopping bags? or,<br>c) hairbrushes?</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br>Hmm, I guess the first thing to be made of plastic was a hairbrush.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK, Beth, I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Dr Sherri Mason is Professor of Chemistry at Penn State University in the US, and a specialist in plastic pollution. Her award-winning 2017 research into microplastics in rivers led to the US Congress banning <strong>microbeads</strong>. Here, she explains the problem of plastics to BBC World Service programme, The Real Story:</p>\n<p><strong>Dr Sherri Mason</strong><br>Plastic is <strong>synthetic</strong> and, as a consequence of that, nature doesn't really know what to do with it. Like, a paper bag that's sitting on the side of the road - it's <strong>unsightly</strong> but within weeks there are organisms in the soil that can use that paper bag as a food source, right… they have evolved to basically chew up that paper bag and turn it back into soil, turn it back into carbon and nitrogen and oxygen. But with regard to plastic because it is a <strong>synthetic</strong> material you don't have that evolution. There are some organisms that can use it as a food source, but they're <strong>few and far between</strong>, especially when you're talking about water systems, aquatic systems and the temperatures that exist, and so they can't really use it as a food source so plastic doesn't <strong>biodegrade</strong>…</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br>Plastic is a <strong>synthetic</strong> material, meaning that it’s made by combining man-made chemicals, instead of existing naturally. Natural materials like paper decay and harmlessly turn back into soil – they <strong>biodegrade</strong>. But plastic is not like this. It doesn’t decay and get broken down by microbes and bacteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>In fact, some plastic-eating microbes and bacteria do exist, but these are <strong>few and far between</strong>, they’re rare, and don’t happen very often. It’s the fact that plastic doesn’t decay which is responsible for the waste we see in the environment, waste which is often <strong>unsightly</strong>, meaning ugly and unpleasant to look at.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br>Fortunately, help is at hand. The plastic-eating microbes Neil mentioned, especially one called Rhodococcus ruber, have been tested by scientists and seem capable of breaking down plastic into its basic components. What’s also needed is an emphasis on reducing plastic production, especially packaging and other single-use products, rather than simply recycling. Action like this should help plastic achieve its original purpose – to help preserve, not pollute, our natural resources. And speaking of the origins of plastic, isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Right. I asked you which object made of natural materials was the first to be replaced by plastic. You said it was a hairbrush which was… the wrong answer I'm afraid, Beth. In fact the first plastic-moulding machine was used in 1872 to produce snooker balls. OK let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme starting with <strong>single-use plastics</strong> - plastic products which are designed to be used just once before being thrown away.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br><strong>Microbeads</strong> are tiny plastic particles found in products like toothpastes and body scrubs which can enter and pollute rivers, seas, and the human body.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>The adjective <strong>synthetic</strong> describes a non-natural material made by combining chemicals.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br>To <strong>biodegrade</strong> means to decay naturally, in a way that is not harmful to the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>The phrase <strong>few and far between</strong> means very rare or not happening very often.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth</strong><br>And finally, if something is described as <strong>unsightly</strong>, it’s ugly and unpleasant to look at. Once again our six minutes are up. Join us next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Goodbye!</p></div>"

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Phil.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>And I’m Beth.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>Today we’re going to be talking about an interesting approach to the problem of invasive species. When animals or plants are introduced to new areas, they can be dangerous for existing wildlife.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>Tell me about it! Every time I plant something in my garden, squirrels dig it up. I’m getting really fed up with them.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>Have you tried eating them?</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>Sorry, what? Eat the squirrels?</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>That’s right! One of the simplest ways to deal with invasive species is just to eat them. In this programme we’ll be hearing about initiatives in the UK and Belize that are trying to get people to improve things using their stomachs.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>OK, but before that, I’ve got a question for you, Phil. Lionfish are aggressive predators which hunt over 50 different varieties of fish. To help them do this, their stomachs can expand, but by how much?</p>\n<p>Is it:</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 times its original size<br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 times or<br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 times</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>Wow, those numbers all seem incredibly big – I mean it can’t be more than 10 times can it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>Well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>Before that, let’s get back to your squirrel problem! There’ a restaurant in London that offers squirrel kebabs. They specialise in food made from invasive species, so if that’s not to your taste you could try Japanese knotweed beer.</p>\n<p>This invasive plant has caused a lot of problems in the UK. But just why is it so damaging? &nbsp;&nbsp;Host of BBC World Service Programme ‘People Fixing the World’ Myra Anubi explains:</p>\n<p><strong>Myra Anubi<br></strong>Japanese knotweed is an extremely invasive plant that arrived in Europe from Japan over a century ago, this super weed doesn't just grow fast. It has root systems that are so strong and <strong>resilient</strong> that they can <strong>withstand</strong> molten lava <strong>choke out</strong> surrounding plants and cause a lot of damage to buildings.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>Myra tells us that Japanese knotweed is <strong>resilient</strong>. If something or someone is <strong>resilient</strong> then it means that it or they can resist attempts to stop them.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>And another word for ‘resist’ is <strong>withstand</strong>. If you can withstand an attack or damage then you don’t let it affect you. We heard that Japanese knotweed’s roots can <strong>withstand</strong> lava from a volcano.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>We also heard that Japanese knotweed can ‘<strong>choke out</strong>’ other plants. By this we mean that it takes the space and the resources such as light and water that they need to survive.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>And knotweed is not the only invasive species problem with a tasty solution. In Belize, since 2008 lionfish have had a massive impact on coral reefs and native wildlife. They can eat four times as much as native species. BBC World Service programme ‘People Fixing the World’ went to investigate. Here’s Marisol Amaya talking to Celso Sho from marine conservation NGO, ‘Blue Ventures’ about attempts by the Belizean government to get people to eat lionfish.</p>\n<p><strong>Marisol Amaya<br></strong>With a big campaign slogan ‘Eat the lion’, they got <strong>renowned</strong> chefs to prepare it in exotic ways to raise awareness that eating lionfish was both tasty and helping the environment.</p>\n<p><strong>Celso Sho<br></strong>We have developed awareness for the restaurants to purchase it. We had a lot of <strong>outreach</strong> trying to erm show <strong>fisheries</strong>, the general public how to remove the spine, then that allows them actually eat the meat from the fish.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>We heard the Belizean government asked <strong>renowned</strong> chefs to prepare lionfish dishes. <strong>‘Renowned</strong>’ means to be well-known for being very good at something.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>Celso Sho talked about <strong>outreach</strong> work. <strong>Outreach</strong> is where an organisation brings their work to people through events or publicity.</p>\n<p><strong>Phi<br></strong><strong>Fisheries</strong> are either the business that breed and catch fish to sell, or the places where that happens.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>So, in Belize people are being shown attractive ways to eat lionfish. And speaking of lionfish and eating, I think it’s time I revealed the answer to our quiz. I asked you by how much can a lionfish expand it’s stomach to eat more.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>And I thought it was 10 times.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>But you were wrong unfortunately, a lionfish can actually make its stomach 30 times bigger. That might help to explain why they are a such a danger to native Belizean fish. OK, now let’s recap the vocabulary that we’ve looked at today. If something is <strong>resilient</strong>, then it’s very hard to damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>Yes, you could say that it can <strong>withstand</strong> a lot of damage – it can cope with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>If one plant <strong>chokes out</strong> another, then it takes away the resources needed to live.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong>If you are <strong>renowned</strong> for something, then you are famous for what you do.</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong><strong>Outreach</strong> is how organisations bring their work to people.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil<br></strong><strong>Fisheries </strong>are the companies that catch and sell fish or the places where they do it. That’s all we’ve got time for today, maybe you might want to see if there any invasive species near you that you might want to eat. See you next time!</p>\n<p><strong>Beth<br></strong>Bye!</p></div>"

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>And I’m Georgie.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>If I told you I’d been for a walk to see Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, you’d know straight away I was in London.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>But what if my walk went passed cafes selling mozzarella and ricotta where I smelled freshly made cannolis and focaccia… Where would I be then?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Focaccia and mozzarella… you’d be in Italy, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>Yes, Italy, or ‘Little Italy’ to be exact – the neighbourhood in some cities where Italian communities settled and made their home.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>These Italian arrivals opened shops and cafes selling food to their own communities. Soon dishes like spaghetti and meatballs attracted the attention of local people, and gradually Italian food became famous around the world. In this programme, we’ll be taking a walk through two Little Italys, one in Argentina, the other in New York, and, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well. But before that, I have a question for you, Georgie. According to a recent YouGov poll, which Italian food is most popular with British diners? Is it:</p>\n<p>a) pizza?<br>b) lasagne? or<br>c) garlic bread?</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>I think it must be pizza.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Okay, Georgie, I’ll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. One country Italians moved to was Argentina. In 1898, Giuseppe Banchero arrived in the neighbourhood of La Boca, the Little Italy of Buenos Aires, where many Italian immigrants started restaurants. Here, Hugo Banchero, grandson of Giuseppe, tells his story to Veronica Smink, reporter for BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:</p>\n<p><strong>Hugo Banchero</strong><br>Well, my grandfather came from Italy, from Genoa, from Liguria. He was born in the centre of Genoa and arrived here in 1898 at the age of seven and a half, and this pizzeria where we are was founded on March 28, 1972. We have been here for 91 years.</p>\n<p><strong>Veronica Smink</strong><br>So what culinary traditions did they bring with them?</p>\n<p><strong>Hugo Banchero</strong><br>Well, our culinary tradition is pizza, and we incorporated the faina from Genoa, which is a pizza with chickpea flour…</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>In 1898, Giuseppe founded his pizzeria – a restaurant selling pizza. When a business is founded, it’s established – someone starts it, or sets it up.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Giuseppe brought the culinary traditions from his home in Liguria in northern Italy, including regional pizzas like faina and fugazzetta. The adjective culinary describes anything connected with cooking.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>But probably the best-known Little Italy in the world is an area of Manhattan’s Lower East side in New York. Ninety percent of Italian immigrants who arrived in the US at the turn of the century came through this neighbourhood.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>De Palos, one of the original shops selling Italian food in Little Italy, has been serving customers for 113 years. Here, Lou De Palo, co-owner and great-grandson of the original owner, Salvino, explains more about his family history to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:</p>\n<p><strong>Lou De Palo</strong><br>1925… when my grandmother, Concetta, and my grandfather, Luigi, got married, they open their own shop… it's the shop we continue today being the fourth generation working alongside my sister, Maria, my brother, Sal, and our children, the fifth generation. Our business has expanded; expanded to represent the full food culture of the 20 regions of Italy. Little Italy is the stepping stone of the Italian immigrant. This is where many of the Italians first came through Ellis Island, and then settled here, and then eventually moved into mainstream America throughout the rest of the country.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>Lou De Palo is the fourth generation of his family to run the shop, and his children will be the fifth. Phrases like fourth or fifth generation describe the children of people whose parents immigrated to a particular country.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>After arriving in New York, many Italian immigrants moved on to start successful new lives elsewhere. That’s why Lou calls Little Italy a stepping stone, an experience that helps you achieve something else, like a real stepping stone helps you cross a river. As a result, Italian newcomers became accepted in mainstream America, mainstream meaning the culture and customs viewed as ‘normal’ by most Americans.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>It seems we owe a lot to Little Italy. But we still don’t know which food is most popular here in the UK. Isn’t it time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil?</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Right. I asked you which Italian food is most popular in Britain and you said pizza, which would be my guess too, but is… the wrong answer, I'm afraid! In fact, the top choice for Italian food fans here in the UK is garlic bread. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme on Little Italy, starting with pizzeria, a restaurant that sells pizza.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>If something is founded, it’s started or established.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>The adjective culinary describes anything connected with cooking.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>Phrases like the fourth or fifth generation describe the children of people whose parents immigrated to a particular country.</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>A stepping stone is an event or experience that helps you advance or achieve something new.</p>\n<p><strong>Georgie</strong><br>And finally, the adjective mainstream describes the customs and culture which are accepted as ‘normal’ by most people in a society. Once again our six minutes are up. Until the next time here at 6 Minute English, it’s ciao!</p>\n<p><strong>Neil</strong><br>Ciao!</p></div>"

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>And I’m Georgina. Have you finished writing that report yet, Neil?<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>Err, not quite – it’s almost done.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>Well, finish it this morning please, then make sure you’ve planned all the studio sessions for the week and show me so I can double check, OK?<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>[Sigh] OK. Has this ever happened to you? Being <strong>micromanaged</strong> by someone? That’s what it’s called when your boss wants to control everything, down to the smallest detail.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>…and I notice you’ve written the report in font size 11 when I told you to use size 12!<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>[Sigh] If this keeps up I’m might <strong>go on strike</strong>. It wouldn’t be the first time someone has refused to continue working because of an argument with their boss.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>Hmm, maybe I’d better go easy on Neil. After all, I don’t want a repeat of what happened on the American spaceship, Skylab - the subject of this programme.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>In 1973, three US astronauts on board the Skylab space station had a disagreement with mission control over their workload in an incident that has, incorrectly, been called the Skylab space ‘strike’. But before we find out more, let me ask you my quiz question – if that’s OK, boss?<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>Go ahead.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>Well, the Skylab astronauts felt they had been given too much work to complete during the space flight. But how did they protest to their bosses at ground control? Did they…<br>a) pretend the radio had broken?<br>b) stop shaving and grew beards?, or,<br>c) fake the results of their experiments?<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>I guess, a) pretending the radio had broken, would show them who’s boss – although floating in space without radio contact sounds a bit dangerous to me!<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>OK, Georgina, we’ll find out what really happened later. Now, Skylab was planned to be the fourth – and final - crewed flight to orbit the Earth.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>For scientists it was the last chance to test out their theories in space and the Skylab crew were asked to study everything about space travel, from its effects on the human body to how spiders make webs.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>Here’s one of the Skylab astronauts, Ed Gibson, telling Lucy Burns, presenter of BBC World Service programme, Witness History, how they communicated with ground control:<br><strong>Ed Gibson</strong><br>We got our instructions over a teleprinter. One morning we had about 60 feet of teleprinter message to cut up and divide up and understand before we even get to work.<br><strong>Lucy Burns</strong><br>All space missions run to a <strong>tight schedule</strong> all the way down to exercise times and meal breaks but the Skylab 4 astronauts felt their ground control team was being particularly <strong>bossy</strong>.<br><strong>Ed Gibson</strong><br>I don’t know if any of you have ever had to work… do something under the conditions of <strong>micromanagement</strong> – it’s bad enough for an hour, but try <strong>24 hours a day</strong>… we’re just not constructive that way, we’re not getting things done the way we should because we couldn’t use our own judgment.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>With so many experiments to carry out and a limited time in space, the Skylab crew had a <strong>tight schedule</strong> - a small amount of time to finish a job.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>Bosses at ground control sent radio messages every morning, detailing exactly their duties for that day. They sound like real micromanagers, Neil!<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>Absolutely! Or in other words, <strong>bossy</strong> - always telling people what to do!<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>Astronaut, Ed Gibson, wanted to use his professional judgement to complete the work, not be bossed around by ground control <strong>24 hours a day</strong> – an expression meaning, all day and night.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>When one of the astronauts got sick, it was decided that they would take turns talking to ground control.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>But one day, all three of them missed the daily radio meeting and some Nasa bosses thought they’d gone on strike!<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>In the crisis talks that followed, both crew and ground control agreed better ways of working and communicating – and less micromanagement!<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>But the newspapers had already got hold of the story, and to this day the incident is misremembered as the ‘strike’ in space.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>Here’s Ed Gibson again, speaking to BBC World Service’s, Witness History, on what he learned from the experience:<br><strong>Ed Gibson</strong><br>We all conclude that we learned something from it – <strong>micromanagement</strong> does not work, except when you’re in a situation that demands it like a lift-off or a re-entry… and fortunately I think that’s been passed down to the space station people and they learned that that’s <strong>the way to go</strong>.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>In the end Nasa agreed that trusting people to do their jobs was <strong>the way to go</strong> – the best method for doing a particular thing.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>I told you, Georgina – no-one likes being bossed around!<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>Including the Skylab astronauts! But was my answer correct? About how they protested?<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>Ah yes, in my quiz question, I asked how the Skylab astronauts protested to their bosses. What did you say?<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>I thought the astronauts, a) pretended the radio had broken.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>Ah, good guess, Georgina, but actually the answer was… b) they stopped shaving and grew beards. Unless that was just another experiment?!<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>Let’s recap the vocabulary, starting with <strong>micromanage</strong> – control everything, down to the smallest detail.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>If you’re <strong>bossy</strong>, you’re always telling people what to do.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>But be careful, because your workers might <strong>go on strike</strong> – refuse to work.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>The Skylab astronauts had a <strong>tight schedule</strong> – a small amount of time to complete their jobs. They felt their bosses were watching them <strong>twenty-four hours a day</strong>, or all the time.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>But in the end, trusting people is <strong>the way to go</strong> – the best method of doing something.<br><strong>Neil</strong><br>That’s all for now, but watch this space for more trending topics and useful vocabulary, here at BBC 6 Minute English.<br><strong>Georgina</strong><br>And if you like topical discussions and want to learn how to use the vocabulary found in headlines, why not try out our New Review podcast?
