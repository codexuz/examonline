You should say\n\n\nWhat kind of accommodation it would be\n\n\nWhere it would be\n\n\nWho would live there with you\n\n\nand say why you would enjoy living in this place.\nPaolo: I think most people when answering this question would say they’d like to live in a big detached house with spacious rooms … views of the countryside and so on … but actually my ideal home would be a lot different … I’ve always loved the idea of having a mobile home … a really expensive one with all the mod cons … so I could live wherever I wanted or at least have lots of holidays and be able to take all my home comforts with me whenever I travelled … I realise this would have to be a second home as I’d need a base … a permanent address … but the mobile home would be the accommodation I’d find it exciting to live in … I suppose once I settle down and have children I’ll want to get on the property ladder … I’ll be like everyone else … saving up to put down a deposit on a house or an apartment … I don’t think my family would want to live in a mobile home … but I like to think I’ll still keep that dream home in mind …\nPart 3-style questions\nExaminer: Is it better to own your own home or to rent?\nAna: I think both have their advantages … living in rented accommodation isn’t necessarily a bad thing … you don’t have a huge debt like you do when you take out a mortgage but I suppose the property market offers you an investment for the future … I’m sure that’s why most people prefer to own their own home …\nExaminer: What options are available to young couples looking for accommodation in your country?\nToni: If they want to buy their own home it isn’t easy for first-time buyers … mortgages are hard to get so most people live with their parents or in rented accommodation … but that can also be very expensive … you often have to pay rent in advance … and if the accommodation isn’t fully furnished you have the expense of buying furniture …\nExaminer: What are some of the pleasures involved in making a home for ourselves?\nSuki: I suppose it starts with house-hunting … finding your ideal home … some people enjoy doing up an old property … giving a property that’s old and tired a new lease of life … others like making wherever they live feel like home with some home comforts …\nDefinitions\n(all the) mod cons: technology at home that makes jobs easier such as a washing machine, dishwasher etc.\napartment block: a large building made up of smaller units of apartments\nback garden: a garden at the rear of the house\ndetached house: a house that is not physically connected to another property\nto do up a property: to repair an old building\ndream home: a home you regard as perfect\nfirst-time buyer: someone buying a property for the first time, especially when taking out a loan (mortgage)\nfully-furnished: a rented property with all furniture included\nto get on the property ladder: to buy a property with the aim of buying another bigger or more expensive one later in life\nhall of residence: a college or university building where students live\nhome comforts: things that make a home feel comfortable to live in\nhouse-hunting: looking for a property to live in\nhouse-warming party: a party to celebrate moving into a new home\nideal home: a perfect home\nto live on campus: to live on the university or college grounds\nmobile home: a home that can be moved by a vehicle or one that has its own engine\nto move into: to begin to live in a property\nto own your own home: to have bought the property you live in\nto pay rent in advance: weekly or monthly rent paid at the beginning of the week or month\npermanent address: a fixed address\nproperty market: the buying and selling of land or buildings\nto put down a deposit: to pay an amount of money as the first in a series of future payments\nrented accommodation: property owned by someone else and for which a person pays a fixed amount to live in\nsingle room: a room for one person\nspacious room: a large room\nstudent digs: student accommodation\nthe suburbs: a residential area on the edge of towns or cities\nto take out a mortgage: to borrow a large amount of money, paid back over several years, in order to buy a house\nterraced house: a house connected on both sides by other properties"

You should say\n\n\nWhere this advert appeared\n\n\nWhen you saw it\n\n\nWhat it was advertising\n\n\nand say why you thought it was so effective.\nMax: OK … well this was about 4 years ago … I was looking for some software to create videos … one day I got an email from a mailing list I’d signed up to … there was a link in it to a press release … a company had written something about a new product that was similar to what I was looking for … at the end of the press release there was a link to the sales page … I hadn’t heard of the company but I was interested and clicked the link to the ad …. what caught my attention immediately were the number of testimonials from people who had bought the software … I think testimonials are like the online equivalent of word of mouth advertising and are really persuasive … anyway … when I got to the bottom of the page there was a great big call to action button inviting me to buy … I was totally persuaded and ended up making a purchase … what made it so effective I think was the power of those testimonials … they’d been written by people very much like me … they’d had a need and the software had obviously turned out to be just what they were looking for … when you think that this was a newish company they wouldn’t have had any brand awareness at all … they probably wouldn’t have had much of a budget for advertising … obviously you wouldn’t advertise a product like this through the mass media on TV … they probably didn’t even have an advertising agency to support them …and yet they’d managed to create a great deal of brand loyalty from previous customers … I think that was really effective.\nPart 3-style questions\nExaminer: What is it that makes an advert effective?\nSpencer: Well … when a company launches a product they have to consider the Internet … especially how it can be used to spread the word on social media … so in this context a video that goes viral is probably the most effective type of advert you could make.\nExaminer: What are the advantages to companies of advertising on the Internet rather than TV?\nStelios: I’d imagine the main advantage is you can reach your target audience much more effectively … if you bring out a niche product for example … or you have a tight advertising budget … you can advertise on particular sites that the people you want to reach visit … that’s not something you can do on TV.\nExaminer: What things do advertising companies do that might give it a bad name?\nRaol: For me the most irritating is cold calling … we must get two or three of these every day at work … then there’s junk mail that gets posted through the letterbox … and of course the online equivalent of this … spam emails … I think it’s this kind of advertising that tends to annoy people.\nDefinitions\n\n\nadvertising agency: a company that creates adverts for other companies\n\n\nadvertising budget: the amount of money a company decides to spend on advertising\n\n\nbrand

Jemma: Unfortunately we don’t have a cinema near us so we have to go into the nearest town to catch the latest movie … I usually avoid seeing popular box-office hits which I’m not always keen on seeing … I prefer low-budget films … sci-fi especially … and there’s a great cinema I go to that has frequent showings of films like these …\nExaminer: Do you prefer reading books or watching films?

Alise: Personally I prefer reading a paperback or hardback … especially if I’m reading a classic which I don’t think feels right as an e-book … but I can see it can be good for others … my grandmother has an e-reader and she loves the way you can enlarge the text …\nExaminer: Do you think bookshops will survive the digital revolution? Thomas: I think so … at least I hope so … I love flicking through books in a bookshop … online shopping is useful … finding out on Amazon if a book you want has got a good review … maybe getting one that is difficult to find … but I still love the experience of being in a bookshop …\nExaminer: Statistics show that visits to the cinema are up despite the availability of DVDs and online downloads. Why do you think this might be? Jamie: I think it’s the whole experience that the cinema offers … going out to see a film when it goes on general release … and seeing it on the big screen is more exciting than watching the filmat home on TV … especially if it’s an action movie … and watching it with others makes it even more special …\nDefinitions\n\n\nan action movie: a film with fast moving scenes, often containing violence\n\n\nto be engrossed in: to be completely focused on one thing\n\n\nbedtime reading: something to read in bed before you go to sleep\n\n\nto be a big reader: someone who reads a lot\n\n\nto be based on: to use as a modal\n\n\na box office hit: a financially successful film\n\n\nto be heavy-going: difficult to read\n\n\na blockbuster: a film that is a big commercial success\n\n\nto catch the latest movie: to see a film that has just come out\n\n\nthe central character: the main person in a film or book\n\n\na classic: of the highest quality\n\n\nto come highly recommended: to be praised by another person\n\n\ncouldn’t put it down: wasn’t able to stop reading a book\n\n\nan e-book: a digital book\n\n\nan e-reader: a device for reading e-books\n\n\nto flick through: to look quickly through a book\n\n\nto get a good/bad review: to receive positive or negative feedback\n\n\nto go on general release: when a film can be seen by the general public\n\n\nhardback: a book with a rigid cover (see ‘paperback’ below)\n\n\na historical novel: a story set in the past\n\n\na low budget film: a film made with a small amount of money\n\n\non the big screen: at the cinema\n\n\na page turner: a book that you want to keep reading\n\n\npaperback: a book with a flexible cover (see ‘hardback’ above)\n\n\nplot: the main events in a film or book\n\n\nto read something from cover to cover: to read a book from the first page to the last\n\n\nsci-fi: science fiction\n\n\nto see a film: to see a film at the cinema (see ‘watch a film’ below)\n\n\nthe setting: where the action takes place\n\n\nshowings: performances of a film\n\n\nsoundtrack: the music that accompanies a film\n\n\nspecial effects: the visuals or sounds that are added to a film which are difficult to produce naturally\n\n\nto take ou****t (a book from the library): to borrow a book from the library\n\n\nto tell the story of: to outline the details of someone’s life or an event\n\n\nto watch a film: to watch a film on TV (see ‘to see a film’ above)"

      "content": "Examples of IELTS speaking part 1 questions\nExaminer: What food do you like to eat?\nAnswer: I am not a fussy eater. As long as you don\\‘t feed me rabbit food I\\‘m easy to please. My flatmate and I share the cooking chores. Once a week we make a slap-up meal of steak and chips covered in a rich sauce and to satisfy the sweet tooth we finish off with a decadent chocolate pudding.\nExaminer: So, do you enjoy cooking?\nAnswer: I prefer eating to cooking. I make good use of ready meals and I am not averse to junk food or the occasional pub lunch. I realize though that it is necessary to include nutritious food in my diet, which is why I cook several times a week.\nExaminer: What is your favourite meal of the day?\nAnswer: I’m a breakfast fan. I wake up starving hungry after a good night’s sleep. I like nothing better than a good English breakfast of bacon, eggs, and buttery toast, along with a piping hot cup of coffee.\nIELTS speaking part 2 question\nExaminer: Tell me about your favourite restaurant\nIn this question, you should discuss\nthe restaurant that you like best, why you like it, and the occasions when you go there. Answer: I enjoy fine dining and exotic food. Both are available at my favourite restaurant in the centre of town. On special occasions I take my partner wining and dining. We love the ambience of the candle-lit dinners, and the extensive menu of mouth-watering meals.\nThe menu includes starters, mains and deserts. Usually by the time we get there I am dying of hunger so we order a starter to calm the hunger pangs. We usually also share a bottle of bubbly. It is after all a celebration. Having finished our starter we take our time, savouring the food.\nThis is not the type of restaurant where you would ask for a doggy bag, so we waste nothing. We end the evening with a delicious dessert. After settling the bill, we head off home, satisfied that we have enjoyed a scrumptious meal.\nIELTS speaking part 3 questions\nExaminer: Do you believe that the 21st Century diet is a healthy one?\nAnswer: Far too many people are overweight. I believe that people should cut down on sugars and refined carbohydrates and replace them with leafy vegetables and seasonal fruits. A balanced diet would help them to regulate their weight.\nExaminer: Starvation is a problem in many parts of the world. What do you think should be done about it?\nAnswer: From what I\\‘ve read current global food production can cover the daily consumption needs of the world. We need to find a way to economically transport it to where it is most needed or find alternate food sources. Nobody should starve when there is no shortage of food.\nExaminer: In homes where both parents work do you think cooking has become just another job at the end of the day?\nAnswer: I know that food preparation can be time-consuming, but if everyone helps with ideas and recipes and everyone takes a turn and lends a hand, cooking can be fun for the family. Home cooked meals are also often healthier and packed with vitamins.\nDefinitions\n\n\nA balanced diet - A diet that has the right amount of nutrients\n\n\nA bottle of bubbly - Sparkling wine\n\n\nA decadent chocolate pudding - Luxurious or self-indulgent chocolate pudding\n\n\nA doggy bag - The leftovers of a meal in a restaurant taken home\n\n\nA scrumptious meal - A delicious meal\n\n\nA sweet tooth - An enjoyment of sweet food\n\n\nAn English breakfast - A large cooked breakfast that includes egg and bacon\n\n\nCalm the hunger pangs - To reduce the discomfort caused by hunger\n\n\nCandle lit dinner - A romantic dinner by candlelight\n\n\nCovered in a rich sauce - Covered in a creamy gravy\n\n\nCut down on - To reduce consumption\n\n\nDaily consumption - The amount that you eat everyday\n\n\nDying of hunger - Very hungry\n\n\nExotic meals - Meals that originate in other countries\n\n\nFine dining - Food catering to expensive tastes in a formal setting\n\n\nFood preparation - Preparing food\n\n\nFood production - Producing food\n\n\nFussy eater - Someone dislikes many foods\n\n\nHome cooked meals - Meals cooked at home\n\n\nHomemade food - Food made at home\n\n\nJunk food - Food with little nutritional value\n\n\nLeafy vegetables - Vegetables such as spinach and cabbage\n\n\nMouth-watering meals - Delicious meals\n\n\nNutritious food - Food with many nutrients\n\n\nPacked with vitamins - Full of vitamins\n\n\nPiping hot cup of coffee - Very hot coffee\n\n\nPub lunch - Lunch served in a bar\n\n\nRabbit food - Salad vegetables\n\n\nReady meals - Heat and eat meals\n\n\nRefined carbohydrates - Foods such as white rice, white bread\n\n\nSavouring the food - Enjoying the food\n\n\nScrumptious meal - An exceptionally tasty meal\n\n\nSeasonal fruits - Fruits that grow in season\n\n\nStarving hungry - Extremely hungry\n\n\nWining and dining - Entertainment that includes good food"

We are a close-knit family, and we like to keep in touch with one another, so birthdays, and other celebrations, are noisy crowded affairs.\nExaminer: When was the last time you had a family function?\nAnswer: Our extended family got together last year to celebrate my grandfather\\‘s eightieth birthday. He is very dear to my heart. He has kept up healthy relationships with the whole family, so it was a happy occasion that we all enjoyed.\nExaminer: Would you take a friend on a family holiday?\nAnswer: I have. My family and my best friend got to know each other quite well, as she visited me quite frequently at my home. My family believes that we should nurture our friendships, so they encouraged me to bring my friend along when we took a seaside holiday last year.\nIELTS speaking part 2 - sample question and answer\nExaminer: Tell me about your best friend.\nTo answer this question in full,\ndiscuss who the person is, the circumstances of your meeting, and what it is that you like about them.\nAnswer: My best friend and I got to know each other when we were still very young. We lived in neighbouring houses. We had a lot in common, so we soon hit it off.\nAs we have grown older, we have moved apart. Because of this, we have to some degree lost touch, but anyone who has had a lifelong friend would understand that she will always be dear to my heart.\nWhen we do find ourselves in the same city, we arrange a dinner date, so that we can enjoy each other\\‘s company. We share the same ideas, and we share a common background.\nWe enjoy reminiscing about our past exploits. When we struck up a friendship, as children, we were inseparable. In those early days, we built up a relationship of trust that time and distance cannot break.\nIELTS speaking part 3 - sample questions and answers\nExaminer: Do you think that after-hour friendships between working colleagues are appropriate?\nAnswer: I think that it is important to have a good working relationship. Colleagues should extend the hand of friendship to newcomers in the workplace. I don\\‘t believe, however, that professional relationships should extend into the domestic domain as this may affect office politics.\nExaminer: Do you think that social media is changing the way that we relate to our friends and family?\nAnswer: In some ways yes. Social media allows us to build up relationships with distant cousins, even with those that live on foreign soil. It also helps us to make connections with long lost friends, who we may never have spoken to or seen again. On the other hand, we often spend far too much time on our digital devices instead of socializing face to face.\nExaminer: Do you think that people who enter into a long-term relationship, should continue with their friendships from their single days?\nAnswer: I think that it is important to nurture our friendships whether or not we are in a long-term relationship. Not all relationships stand the test of time, and if you have relationship problems you may one day need a shoulder to cry on. In my view, too many people abandon their friends when they become involved in relationships.\nDefinitions\n\n\nA lifelong friend - A friend that you have had for most of your life\n\n\nA relationship of trust - a connection with another in which you have faith and confidence\n\n\nArrange a dinner date - Plan to share an evening meal\n\n\nA shoulder to cry on - Someone to sympathize with you\n\n\nClose knit family - A close family with common interests\n\n\nDear to my heart - Someone that I care about\n\n\nDistant cousins - People who share a common ancestor but are not closely related\n\n\nExtend the hand of friendship - Reach out to someone in a friendly manner\n\n\nExtended family - Uncles, aunts and cousins form part of the extended family\n\n\nFace to face - In person\n\n\nGet to know one another - Learning different aspects of each other\n\n\nGet together - Meet up\n\n\nImmediate family - Spouse, parents, children, grandparents\n\n\nLong lost friend - A friend that you have lost contact with\n\n\nLong-term relationships - A committed relationship between partners\n\n\nNurture our friendships - Looking after our relationships with friends\n\n\nProfessional relationships - The relationships that we have in the workplace\n\n\nRelationship problems - Difficulties with people with whom we interact regularly\n\n\nShare a common background - The share a similar heritage or culture\n\n\nShare the same ideas - To have similar opinions and views\n\n\nStand the test of time - To last a long time\n\n\nStruck up a friendship - To make friends\n\n\nTo enjoy someone\\‘s company - To enjoy spending time with someone\n\n\nTo have a good working relationship - To work together well\n\n\nTo have a lot in common - To have shared interests\n\n\nTo hit it off - To like each other straight away\n\n\nTo keep in touch with - To keep in contact\n\n\nTo lose touch with - To lose contact"

      "url": "pollution",
      "content": "IELTS speaking part 1 style questions\nExaminer: Has there been an increase in pollution where you live?\nGeorgio: Yes, there has been a dramatic increase in recent years as many of the most productive factories are built on the outskirts of large towns and some are even in quite central areas so very near where people live. Air pollution, as a result of factory emissions and toxic fumes has become a real problem.\nExaminer: How has this pollution had an impact on daily life, do you think?\nHelena: I think there are two key areas which have been most affected – firstly, our health, as air pollution is terrible in the city centre because too many workers commute and rely heavily on their cars rather than travelling by public transport and there are many traffic jams. Secondly, on the quality of crops and in rural areas, where the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in farming has contributed to a dangerous amount of pollutants in foods.\nExaminer: Are residents in your town good at recycling?\nSara: Sadly, in my opinion, not nearly good enough. I know in many European countries, the mantra of reuse and recycle plastics and cardboards has become automatic but here there is still a culture of throwing everything away and most domestic as well as industrial waste is incinerated. Obviously, this policy just contributes to worsening air pollution and to plastic being thrown into the sea.\nIELTS speaking part 2 style question\nDescribe a time when you have caused pollution,\nYou should say:\nWhen this was What it was Where it was And the impact which you think this might have caused.\nZoe: I would like to describe a moment when I was on holiday a few years ago in a really beautiful part of India on holiday with a group of friends. We had been travelling around India for a month and I think I had adjusted to seeing a huge amount of waste on the streets. Not surprisingly, there were very limited facilities for recycling – this is not really part of the culture and it would require a huge investment to put in place the equipment and education programme needed.\nWe were travelling on a train and had been sleeping as it was a very long journey and early the next morning when we pulled into the station, everyone leaned out of the window and purchased bottles of water, cups of tea and hot food from excited street sellers on the platforms.\nI was happy to join in with the locals and without even thinking drank my water then threw the bottle back out of the window which is something I would never have done back home. It wasn\\‘t until later that I understood the consequences of this action.\nAfter winding through the countryside for hours, the train finally reached the coast. I was stunned – rather than a beautiful, clear blue stretch of ocean, all I could see was plastic waste – bottles, bags, food packaging as well as larger items of industrial items were just floating, interspersed with a few seabirds who looked utterly confused and were not really able to swim.\nI could clearly see the impact of my careless action on the train and the problem of plastics in the ocean became horribly evident. With no other way of disposing of rubbish, the temptation, indeed, the default had become to simply throw bottles and bags on the ground or into the sea, river or lake and so much of this has ended up in the ocean. Since then I have been rigorous about waste and campaigned to make sure my local town has widely available recycling bins for all.\nIELTS speaking part 3 style questions\nExaminer: What should be done about plastic in the ocean?\nEmanuel: While quite a lot has been done already to highlight this terrible problem, I think more could be done to make sure the public know the dangers. Apparently around 350 million tonnes of plastic are being produced each year and around 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year.\nIf waste management practices don’t improve, scientists predict this amount could increase tenfold by 2025. What happens is that while paper will eventually disintegrate, plastic does not do this and so when it does eventually break up, it still leaves smaller fragments called microplastics, which have been identified in commercial fish consumed by humans.\nExaminer: What might some solutions be to reduce this situation?\nAlexi: I think many manufactures should work really hard to reduce the use of what is called single-use applications, plastics which are used just once and then disposed of as this makes up approximately half of all plastics. Plastic can quite easily be recycled and used again for shampoo bottles for example. Some large companies have already started only using recycled plastics for their own- brand products and this kind of policy should be rolled out as widely as possible.\nExaminer: What would you say to children who are faced with this problem for the future?\nBenji: I would try to encourage teachers and parents to explain the situation to youngsters but also to try and be positive about what can be done. Firstly, we all need to be much more careful about recycling which is not impossible and should start at school as well as in the home.\nThere have been many incredible documentaries informing us all about the global plastic problem and awareness is a very important stage in beginning to stop the problem. I am not sure what is being done at the moment to remove this mass of plastic but we must make sure we do not make this worse, and we protect our planet as well as the wildlife and birds and we should protect the next generation who will also have to try to find solutions.\nDefinitions\n\n\noutskirts of large towns - areas outside the city centre, suburbs or industrial district\n\n\nfactory emissions - smoke and pollution from factories\n\n\ntoxic fumes - smoke which is poisonous\n\n\ntraffic jams - large queues of cars not moving\n\n\npollutants in foods - dangerous chemicals\n\n\npesticides - chemicals to keep bugs and animals away from plants\n\n\nchemical fertilizers - chemicals added to make soil stronger\n\n\ncommute to work - drive or travel to work every day\n\n\nMantra - frequently repeated statement\n\n\nreuse and recycle - use products again or find another purpose for them\n\n\nindustrial waste is incinerated - waste which is burnt\n\n\nfacilities for recycling - places where you can dispose of plastic / cardboard\n\n\neducation programme - teaching and learning in school or elsewhere\n\n\nconsequences - the outcomes\n\n\ninterspersed with (birds) - mingled with, mixed with\n\n\ncampaign - high profile policy for the public\n\n\nscientists predict - ideas for the future\n\n\ndisintegrate - break down into small particles\n\n\nmicroplastics - very tiny pieces\n\n\nsingle-use applications - use once then throw out\n\n\nown- brand products - unique to the shop or supermarket\n\n\npolicy should be rolled out - implemented all over the country\n\n\ndocumentaries - factual TV programmes"

      "content": "Examples of questions about holiday travel\nExaminer: Where do you like to travel during the holidays?\nAnswer: I like to travel abroad but it can be expensive, so I usually plan affordable travel. Travelling to holiday destinations when it is out of season saves a lot of money. Out of season travel is also the best way to avoid places that are swarming with tourists.\nExaminer: What are your favourite holiday pastimes?\nAnswer: I like to get away from it all. I look for exotic destinations with scenic views that are off the beaten track. I tend to avoid guided tours and packaged deals as I prefer to go sightseeing on my own.\nExaminer: How do you plan and prepare for your holiday?\nAnswer: I always do my research. I thumb through holiday brochures and check travel sites like Airbnb on the Internet. I\\‘m drawn to spectacular beaches and lush forests. I usually make advance reservations for self-catering accommodation.\nPart 2 style questions\nExaminer: Describe one of your best travel experiences.\nThis type of question supports a when, where and who reply.\nAnswer: Last year a friend and I took a long-haul flight to Peru. We were travelling light so we were able to really get around. We stayed in quaint villages and hiked through lush rainforests. We were determined to do as the locals do, so we stayed with local people for part of the trip.\nWe visited colourful craft markets and brought back souvenirs, to remind us of our trip. One of my most memorable experiences was to the Sacred Valley of the Incas. It is a little bit off the beaten track but it is surrounded by great scenic beauty and magnificent landscapes.\nPart 3 style questions\nExaminer: What type of holiday destination do you think attracts most tourists?\nAnswer: I know that many people are drawn to wildlife safaris. This is certainly one of the big attractions in Africa. In Europe and Asia, the stunning architecture, museums and arts and culture attract thousands of tourists every year.\nExaminer: Do you think that the tourism industry will continue to grow in the next two decades?\nAnswer: I do. Many European and Asian countries have aging populations who will have time on their hands in the future. Many of them are likely to seek holiday destinations around the world. Today there are many affordable destinations that offer good value for money.\nExaminer: What do you think that your country could do to attract more tourists?\nAnswer: My country has stringent visa regulations.
