[00:00.00]Jamie Miller - Here's Your Perfect
[00:00.72][Verse 1] I remember the day
[00:02.52]Even wrote down the date
[00:04.65]That I fell for you (Mm-hmm)
[00:08.96]And now it's crossed out in red
[00:10.88]But I still can't forget if I wanted to
[00:15.05] 
[00:17.35]And it drives me insane
[00:19.11]Think I'm hearing your name, everywhere I go
[00:24.94]But it's all in my head
[00:28.91]It's just all in my head
[00:31.43] 
[00:33.78][Pre-Chorus] But you won't see me break
[00:35.91]Call you up in three days
[00:37.97]Or send you a bouquet
[00:39.85]Saying, "It's a mistake"
[00:42.18]Drink my troubles away
[00:44.06]One more glass of champagne
[00:46.16]And you know
[00:49.18][Chorus] I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
[00:53.12]And you're the first to say
[00:54.47]You want the best thing
[00:57.27]But now I know a perfect way to let you go
[01:01.15]Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
[01:05.83]Here's your perfect
[01:07.73][Verse 2] My best was just fine
[01:09.24]How I tried, how I tried to be great for you
[01:13.16] 
[01:16.12]I'm flawed by design and you loved to remind me
[01:19.87]No matter what I do
[01:23.87][Pre-Chorus] But you won't see me break
[01:25.84]Call you up in three days
[01:27.92]Or send you a bouquet, saying, "It's a mistake"
[01:32.18]Drink my troubles away
[01:34.12]One more glass of champagne
[01:36.33]And you know
[01:39.21][Chorus] I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
[01:43.12]And you're the first to say you want the best thing
[01:47.44]But now I know a perfect way to let you go
[01:51.35]Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
[01:55.99]I'm the first to say that I'm not perfect
[01:59.98]And you're the first to say you
[02:01.49]Want the best thing (Best thing, yeah)
[02:04.16]But now I know a perfect way to let you go
[02:07.79]Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
[02:12.41][Outro] Say yeah, yeah, yeah~
[02:18.09]Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
[02:20.79]But now I know a perfect way to let you go
[02:24.63]Give my last hello, hope it's worth it
[02:29.38]Here's your perfect
