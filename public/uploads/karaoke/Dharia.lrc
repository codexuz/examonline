[00:05.67] Some keep a diary
[00:08.13] Seems like a fantasy
[00:10.36] But it may require some love and desire
[00:12.86] It's something to cover me
[00:15.20] There's never a guarantee
[00:17.73] That loving is so easy
[00:20.15] Some may define it as sugar and brownies
[00:22.71] But sour just as lime is
[00:23.95] Ooh, nai-a-nai
[00:25.84] Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
[00:29.04] Nai, na-na-nai
[00:33.21] Ooh, nai-a-nai
[00:35.61] Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
[00:39.79] Nai, na-na-nai
[01:03.48] Some of the ocean breeze
[01:05.81] Somewhere you promised me
[01:08.11] A love like a fire, no fears, no denial
[01:10.27] Just something to gladden me
[01:12.88] I feel electricity
[01:15.36] Your lighting is guiding me
[01:17.76] I fear that I like it
[01:18.68] No place we can hide it
[01:20.06] So hard not to find it
[01:21.34] Ooh, nai-a-nai
[01:23.75] Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
[01:27.86] Nai, na-na-nai
[01:30.89] Ooh, nai-a-nai
[01:33.27] Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
[01:37.29] Nai, na-na-nai
[02:00.71] The reason why we don't give up on our love is simple
[02:05.09] We're like the sun and moon
[02:07.89] We like to see each other shining bright
[02:09.24] We have tonight, tomorrow
[02:12.25] And the other days that follow
[02:15.25] We have to try to make things right
[02:17.56] I'll sing to you like
[02:18.88] Ooh, nai-a-nai
[02:21.13] Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
[02:25.26] Nai, na-na-nai
[02:28.37] Ooh, nai-a-nai
[02:30.82] Ooh, nai, nai-nai, na-na-nai
[02:35.01] Nai, na-na-nai
[03:08.60] The reason, the reason, the reason why
