[00:08.68]In the dark of night
[00:11.73]The stars light up the sky
[00:16.58]We see them flying free
[00:20.83]That's just like you and me
[00:24.02]
[00:25.13]Everyone is lonely sometimes (Sometimes)
[00:29.25]But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes
[00:33.45]You are not alone, we are family (Family)
[00:37.69]Hold me, let's escape all this reality
[00:40.81]
[00:41.91]You are my symphony
[00:46.03]By your side, we are unity
[00:50.23]You are my energy
[00:54.32]My guiding light, we are unity
[01:01.45](We are, we are) We are unity
[01:09.09](We are, we are) We are unity
[01:14.22]
[01:15.36]Although the rain might pour
[01:19.35]A thunder starts to roar
[01:23.54]The lightnin' wakes the wave
[01:27.76]But through it, we are brave
[01:31.52]
[01:31.91]Everyone is lonely sometimes (Sometimes)
[01:36.14]But I would walk a thousand miles to see your eyes
[01:40.24]You are not alone, we are family (Family)
[01:44.39]Hold me, let's escape all this reality
[01:47.32]
[01:48.59]You are my symphony
[01:52.81]By your side, we are unity (We are unity)
[01:55.92]You are my energy
[02:00.90]My guiding light, we are unity
[02:08.97](We are, we are) We are unity
[02:15.90](We are, we are) We are unity
[02:36.10]We are unity
[02:37.65]
[02:38.78]You are my symphony (We are)
[02:42.96]By your side (We are, we are unity, unity)
[02:47.13]You are my energy (We are)
[02:51.33]My guiding light (We are), unity
[03:01.17]We are unity
[03:09.48]We are unity
