    "question": "Should professionals be required to work in their home country after completing their training?",
    "paragraph": "While many people hold the belief that professionals, including doctors and engineers, bear a responsibility to their home country where they received their training, I hold the view that they should have the freedom to work in any country they prefer due to the potential for higher earnings.\nOn one hand, it is argued that professionals often receive significant financial support from their government to complete their training. It is only reasonable that they reciprocate this support by contributing their skills to the same country. This is especially justified because their work often brings substantial benefits to society, which is why the government invested in their education in the first place. For instance, in the UK, substantial funds are allocated to train junior doctors, covering university tuition fees and on-the-job training.\nHowever, every individual should be afforded the opportunity to reach their full potential. Professionals, by virtue of their qualifications, represent some of the most highly skilled individuals globally. Consequently, there is a high demand for their expertise worldwide, allowing them to command significantly higher salaries when working abroad. Restricting their ability to do so would result in a considerable financial disadvantage for the individual. Take, for example, petroleum engineers who can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars more in oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia compared to staying in Europe. In my opinion, the individual's right to choose where they work should take precedence over any nationalist sentiments.\nIn conclusion, despite the substantial investment in a professional's education and training, they should have the autonomy to decide whether to give back to their home country through their work or seek opportunities in regions that offer higher compensation for their skills."

    "question": "Should we prioritize researching our family history or focusing on the present and future generations?",
    "paragraph": "Some people argue that we should research our family history, while others believe we should focus on the present and future generations. This essay will discuss both viewpoints and present my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are significant benefits to understanding our family's past. One of the most important advantages is the ability to identify genetic diseases like asthma and Down syndrome. Detecting these inherited health issues early allows for timely treatment, potentially saving lives and improving overall quality of life. Additionally, delving into family history can strengthen the bonds among family members. Research often uncovers not only the origins of the family but also the stories of sacrifice and determination that our ancestors displayed in overcoming challenges. These stories can instill a deep sense of pride and belonging in future generations.\nHowever, there are valid reasons to prioritize the present and future generations. The most compelling reason is the need to address urgent contemporary issues such as housing, employment, and nutrition. Tackling these pressing problems can significantly enhance people's living standards, leading to a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Furthermore, the financial and time resources used for historical research could be better invested in the development of children. Properly nurtured children have the potential to become capable and responsible individuals who not only create prosperity for themselves but also support their family members. Neglecting their development in favor of past research might hinder their growth.\nIn conclusion, both perspectives have their merits. However, I believe that prioritizing the present and future generations is essential due to the urgency of addressing current pressing problems and the significance of nurturing children. Therefore, it is crucial for adult family members to collaborate and create a comprehensive plan for the effective allocation of resources to meet these immediate and important needs."

    "question": "To what extent does leadership depend on innate qualities versus learned skills?",
    "paragraph": "There is a prevailing belief that some individuals possess innate leadership abilities, while others contend that leadership skills can be acquired through learning. While it is true that some exceptional leaders have natural talents, I concur that the process of training plays a significant role in shaping great leaders.\nTo begin with, many people are born with certain leadership qualities, such as courage, as an inherent part of their personality. It is important to note that effective leaders must develop the ability to make decisions confidently, which typically evolves over time. They need to demonstrate persistence and not shy away from making choices. Additionally, they must take responsibility for their failures and setbacks. These traits gradually develop as they navigate through life. Therefore, it is essential for leaders to be resolute in defining their goals.\nOn the contrary, proponents of the idea that leadership skills can be learned argue that training programs provide individuals with opportunities to enhance their leadership attributes. For instance, in a professional setting, discipline plays a crucial role in a leader's personal qualities. Such discipline is often instilled through classroom-based training, where participants are required to strictly adhere to schedules and complete challenging tasks. Moreover, various lessons and activities provide them with the chance to hone their problem-solving skills. Regular classroom training, for instance, equips people with the confidence to address unexpected challenges, thanks to the valuable guidance offered by experienced instructors who specialize in specific areas.\nIn conclusion, I believe that there are valid arguments on both sides of this debate. Exceptional leaders with innate qualities, including courage, can indeed make significant contributions to their personal development, which is closely tied to their success as leaders. Simultaneously, there are essential leadership attributes that can be acquired through practical training courses."

    "question": "What are the causes of the increasing demand for food worldwide, and how can the international community address this challenge?",
    "paragraph": "The global population is swiftly increasing, and consequently, the demand for food is on the rise as well. This essay will explore the reasons behind the escalating demand for food and the steps that the international community can take to address this issue.\nOne of the primary reasons for the heightened demand for food worldwide is the steadily growing global population. As the population continues to expand, so does the need for food. A notable illustration of the connection between population growth and food demand is evident in China's case. Over the past few decades, China's population has grown significantly, leading to a corresponding increase in the demand for food. Additionally, alterations in dietary preferences and an uptick in urbanization have also played a role in the surge in food demand. As people migrate to urban areas, they often adopt more processed, high-calorie diets, which further fuel the demand for food.\nTo address this situation, the international community can implement several measures. Firstly, promoting sustainable agricultural practices can boost food production while minimizing the environmental impact of farming. For example, sustainable farming techniques like conservation tillage, crop diversification, and agroforestry have proven effective in enhancing soil health, reducing erosion, and increasing water efficiency. These practices lead to more sustainable and productive farming systems. Secondly, investing in research and development to enhance crop yields, develop drought-resistant crops, and refine farming methods can enhance agricultural productivity. Through more efficient irrigation systems, improved fertilizers, and better pest control methods, we can assist farmers in producing more food with less land, water, and other resources. This, in turn, contributes to meeting the surging global demand for food.\nIn conclusion, the mounting demand for food worldwide stems from various complex factors. To address this challenge, the international community can adopt measures such as promoting sustainable agriculture, investing in research and development, and minimizing food wastage."

    "question": "What are the three primary types of relationships that shape human lives, and how do they contribute to personal growth and development?",
    "paragraph": "Nearly all individuals on Earth live within a community, engaging in a variety of human relationships. Among these, family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships hold particular importance.\nFirstly, family relationships are established from birth. Families come in various sizes, including immediate families, which consist of parents and their children, and extended families, where multiple generations reside together under one roof. These relationships are formed not only through blood ties but also through legal bonds, such as adoption. Regardless of the type of family one belongs to or how they became part of it, family relationships play a crucial role in upbringing, shaping people's attitudes, and influencing their behavior in later life.\nSocial development is closely linked to personal growth. After family relationships, individuals enter into friendships, often with those of a similar age and shared hobbies during childhood, and common interests and life goals as adults. Friendships are built on shared experiences, and friends are often the ones to whom people confide their secrets when they find it challenging to do so with family members, particularly during adolescence when teenagers spend a significant amount of time at school with their peers. However, it's important to note that not all friends can be trusted equally; true, lasting friendships are developed over time.\nLastly, romantic relationships also play a significant role in most people's lives. People have deep emotional connections with their romantic partners, and these relationships typically progress through phases of love, where passion is strong initially but may diminish over time. In contrast, feelings of trust, emotional intimacy, and commitment tend to grow stronger as the relationship matures beyond the stages of dating and marriage. A key lesson in romantic relationships is learning to respect differences to nurture a lifelong, fulfilling partnership.\nIn conclusion, three primary types of relationships shape human lives: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. Each of these connections offers valuable opportunities for personal growth and development, enabling individuals to become the best versions of themselves and cultivate meaningful, quality relationships with others."

    "paragraph": "Most individuals around the world lead communal lives, engaged in various and intricate human relationships. Among these, three fundamental types of relationships stand out: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships.\nTo begin with, family relationships are established from birth. People belong to diverse family structures, such as immediate families comprising parents and their children, or extended families where multiple generations reside together. Beyond blood connections, family ties can also be formed through legal bonds, such as adoption. Regardless of the type of family one is a part of or how they became members, family relationships play a pivotal role in upbringing, shaping individuals' attitudes and behaviors as they progress in life.\nAs people grow and develop, their social lives evolve accordingly. Following family relationships, individuals enter into friendships, often with peers of similar age and shared interests, especially during childhood. Over time, friends accumulate shared experiences, and it is not uncommon for people to confide in their closest friends about matters they find challenging to discuss with family members, particularly teenagers who spend a significant amount of time at school with their friends. However, it is important to note that not every acquaintance can be trusted; true, enduring friendships, often referred to as \"best friends,\" are built over time.\nLastly, romantic relationships occupy a significant portion of human lives. People experience unique emotions in their romantic partnerships, which vary based on their love phase. In general, the intensity of passionate feelings tends to diminish as relationships progress, while sentiments of trust, emotional intimacy, and commitment tend to grow stronger beyond the initial stages of knowing each other, dating, and getting married. In romantic relationships, a valuable lesson is to embrace and respect differences in order to maintain a lifelong, fulfilling partnership.\nIn conclusion, there are three primary categories of human relationships that significantly impact one's life: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. Each of these relationships offers opportunities for personal growth and development, helping individuals become the best versions of themselves and fostering high-quality connections with others."

    "paragraph": "There is a debate regarding whether individuals should delve into their family history to learn more about the past, or whether their focus should be on the present and future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and provide reasons for my belief that concentrating on the present and the future is essential for sustainable development.\nSupporters of exploring family history put forward two valid arguments. The primary one is that information about the past carries significant cultural value regarding the traditions and heritage of one's lineage. This knowledge can create an intangible connection to one's ancestors, instilling a sense of belonging and pride. Moreover, people can learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them. By drawing lessons from their forebears, they can pass on life experiences and wisdom to younger generations, enabling them to make informed decisions when they encounter similar situations.\nHowever, an alternative perspective argues that it is more crucial to be oriented towards the present and the future. The driving force behind this argument is that people can address pressing issues and make necessary adjustments in the ever-evolving world. Modern challenges such as climate change, poverty, and other social problems require immediate action and innovative thinking. Furthermore, many family traditions and beliefs have become outdated and unsuitable for today's society. Therefore, to ensure that social progress is not hindered by obsolete customs and ideologies, people should direct their attention towards the present and future generations. This way, younger individuals can develop their own sets of values and eliminate inappropriate practices.\nIn conclusion, while discovering ancestral backgrounds can help preserve important family cultures and offer invaluable life lessons, I believe that emphasizing the present and future generations is more effective in addressing ongoing challenges and promoting sustainable personal growth. Therefore, I am convinced that contemporary and future age groups should receive more attention from the general public."

    "paragraph": "Many individuals often prioritize salary when selecting a job. In my view, I strongly disagree with this perspective.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge the importance of money in meeting one's basic needs such as housing, food, healthcare, and education. People generally consider earning a sufficient income as a primary means to afford these necessities and maintain a reasonable quality of life. For instance, individuals who pursue careers driven by their passions, like artists and musicians, often struggle financially. While they follow their love, their chosen professions may not provide them with enough income to live comfortably or support a family.\nOn the other hand, I believe that certain factors outweigh monetary considerations when making job choices. Firstly, the quality of personal relationships and the work environment play a pivotal role in job satisfaction. Having supportive managers and congenial colleagues can significantly contribute to one's career growth and overall happiness at work. Secondly, aligning one's career with their educational background and field of study is crucial. When a job aligns with one's major, they are more likely to excel and perform exceptionally in that role. Lastly, many individuals select their professions with the intention of making a positive impact on society and helping others.\nIn conclusion, while salary is undeniably important for meeting basic needs, a strong attachment to one's work and job satisfaction are equally crucial for a fulfilling life. I firmly believe that considerations beyond monetary compensation should take precedence when choosing a career path."

    "question": "Should medical services be controlled by the government or by private companies?",
    "paragraph": "In today's world, there is an ongoing debate regarding the control of medical services, with some advocating for government oversight and others favoring private companies. While some argue that governments should primarily manage medical services, I firmly believe that entrusting this responsibility to private firms offers more advantages.\nOn one hand, government involvement seems reasonable to some extent. This is primarily due to the financial resources available to the state and its ability to mobilize resources, making it crucial in ensuring medical services' availability to the general population. By allocating state funds to establish public hospitals and healthcare centers in underserved areas, governments can guarantee that even the most vulnerable individuals have access to essential medical treatments. In contrast, private companies often prioritize profit generation, which may lead to higher costs and limited accessibility.\nOn the other hand, while government participation in public welfare is undoubtedly essential, I recognize that allowing private companies to manage medical services can provide greater benefits for several compelling reasons. Firstly, the substantial cost of providing healthcare to the community could strain government finances, potentially resulting in budget deficits, tax increases, or reduced social welfare. Consequently, ordinary citizens, especially the underprivileged, may face even greater financial challenges. Furthermore, it is vital to acknowledge that private companies can make significant contributions to the healthcare sector by introducing competition and innovation. This can be further reinforced by the coexistence of private healthcare providers alongside government facilities, fostering a healthy competitive environment that encourages all parties to strive for excellence and improve the quality of care.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of the government taking charge of medical services may appeal to some, I argue that private enterprises should be entrusted with this responsibility."

    "paragraph": "In recent decades, it is evident that private healthcare has become increasingly vital in our society. However, some individuals argue that good health and well-being are essential for everyone, and thus healthcare services should not be overseen by privately-owned profit-driven companies. While this trend has brought certain advantages, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh them.\nOn one hand, private healthcare facilities like hospitals and clinics can alleviate the burden on public medical centers. For instance, during outbreaks such as COVID-19 or the SARS outbreak in 2003, when the number of hospitalized patients surged daily, employing private healthcare services could assist state-owned hospital staff in providing better care for their patients and alleviate the strain on the public healthcare system.\nOn the other hand, I contend that these drawbacks are more significant than the benefits. Firstly, if private companies manage medical services, private health insurance becomes imperative to avoid the high costs. Moreover, this may lead to increased competition among health insurance providers, resulting in higher premiums. Lastly, governments can ensure equitable access to hospitals, while private companies tend to concentrate their hospitals mainly in metropolitan areas because it is challenging to generate profits in smaller, less populated towns.\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that the drawbacks of entrusting medical services to profit-driven companies outweigh the benefits they bring to citizens. Private health insurance should remain an option rather than a mandatory prerequisite for accessing medical services."

    "paragraph": "In recent years, significant cultural transformations have occurred worldwide due to the exchange of cultures, bringing various parts of the world closer together. Some argue that the annual disappearance of numerous languages is not a significant issue because it will not hinder communication. From my perspective, I agree with this view that the disappearance of less widely spoken languages is not a crucial problem.\nFirst and foremost, language primarily serves as a means of communication, and the number of speakers plays a pivotal role in this context. English, for example, has become an international language with a large number of speakers, especially after the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, individuals seeking international employment opportunities must possess proficiency in English to enhance their knowledge, career prospects, and financial situations. Therefore, if the global population adopts a common language, many individuals can reduce the educational demands placed upon them. For instance, people can allocate the time they would have spent on language studies to other educational pursuits, and parents would be relieved of the financial burden of enrolling their children in English courses.\nA second reason why I believe that the decline of less widely spoken languages, particularly those of ethnic minorities, is not a problem relates to finances. Moreover, it can enhance individuals' capacity for skill development by affording them the opportunity to access diverse global sources of knowledge. Less commonly spoken languages often hinder many individuals from acquiring valuable knowledge. Ultimately, a common language can facilitate connections among all individuals who share a common knowledge base.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the extinction of some less spoken languages would bring about significant changes, providing us with more convenience in the global village."

This has sparked an ongoing debate about who should be responsible for medical services, whether it should be the government or profit-making companies. In my view, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement, and this essay will explain the reasons supporting this stance.\nTo start, when medical systems are under government management, it ensures that everyone has an equal chance to access medical services, regardless of their financial situation. For instance, in the United States, when private companies took over medical services from the government, the prices for services such as general checkups and surgeries significantly increased.

This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this trend.\nThere are several reasons that contribute to this phenomenon, primarily driven by the advantages it offers to individuals. For instance, individuals may relocate to access a wider range of job opportunities in larger cities, providing them with significant career advantages. Some people may choose to live closer to their workplace, which can significantly reduce their commute time and increase their efficiency. Additionally, there are individuals who prefer to work independently and do not rely on their family for support.\nHowever, this trend also presents various challenges for both individuals and their families. Those who live far from their families often experience feelings of loneliness because they can only communicate with their loved ones through phone calls or messages. Prolonged periods of work-related stress can be difficult to manage without the support and comfort of family members or close friends. Being unable to share their problems with loved ones and friends can lead to emotional breakdowns.\nWhile there are undeniable advantages to this trend, such as enhanced job prospects and income potential, I believe that these advantages cannot outweigh the disadvantages.

While some argue in favor of watching TV, I firmly believe that reading is a crucial key to stimulating people's minds.\nIt is undeniable that TV shows can easily capture people's attention due to their captivating visuals, especially for the younger generation. However, they leave little room for our imagination to soar. TV shows and films often convey information through the words and actions of characters, resulting in passive consumption. Viewers simply absorb the content without actively processing or questioning it. Moreover, the fast pace of screen-based entertainment makes it challenging for viewers to fully grasp the author's deeper meaning.\nOn the contrary, reading books not only enriches the imaginative process but also fosters creativity. It can be seen as a source of entertainment because people can utilize their imagination to picture the characters and settings. For example, I once envisioned the chaotic sinking scene of the Titanic after reading the classic romance novel \"Romeo and Juliet.\" I felt like I was immersed in that atmosphere, which evoked sympathy for the two main characters. Additionally, cultivating a reading habit helps us expand our vocabulary and grasp various grammatical structures, which are vital components for improving language proficiency.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that watching TV encourages passive behavior and does not offer the same level of cognitive engagement and linguistic benefits as reading.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this idea?\nI mostly disagree with the viewpoint that children should engage in work alongside their academic studies. First and foremost, children attend school primarily to acquire knowledge, not to participate in labor. Due to their young age, children's mental and physical faculties are not yet fully developed for performing work tasks. Their primary role in school is to acquire fundamental skills in subjects such as mathematics and literacy. Additionally, schools provide a conducive environment for young learners to engage in conversations with their peers on various topics of interest and to develop essential soft skills, all without the constant supervision of their parents.\nFor example, it is crucial for children to grasp basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division, as these are fundamental life skills. However, delving into the complexities of the world of work is not a primary objective of the educational system. Indeed, many schools worldwide do not incorporate work-related instruction into their curriculum.\nOn the other hand, the world of work is better suited for older adolescents, typically around the age of 18. When students decide to pursue tertiary education, it signifies their intent to gain in-depth knowledge in a specific field, which will serve them in their future careers. Consequently, they can simultaneously study academic subjects and engage in internships in various workplaces to gain practical experience. Conversely, for those who do not pursue further education, the age of 18 is an appropriate time to enter the workforce, as they have reached a level of intellectual and physical maturity that makes them better prepared for employment.\nIn conclusion, I oppose the notion that children should spend a brief period working while they are still in school because they lack the necessary maturity for the world of work. The teaching of work-related skills should coincide with their physical and mental development, which typically occurs around the age of 18."

    "paragraph": "There is a viewpoint that argues that medical services, being essential for human well-being, should not be driven by profit-oriented companies. While there are indeed certain drawbacks to this idea, I believe that the positive impacts outweigh the negatives.\nOn one hand, private healthcare systems do come with some disadvantages. One significant drawback is the steep cost that patients have to bear. This is primarily because private hospitals incur substantial expenses on amenities such as state-of-the-art medical equipment in the operating rooms, deluxe accommodations, and competitive salaries for medical professionals. For instance, consider a pregnant woman who opts for Vinmec, the largest private international hospital in Vietnam; she may end up paying double or even triple the amount compared to a state-run hospital. Consequently, private healthcare can be financially burdensome for individuals who cannot afford these costs, potentially creating an inequality in access to care and treatment.\nOn the other hand, an increasing number of private hospitals today offer various benefits. Firstly, they provide quicker services compared to public health facilities where long waiting lists are often the norm. As a result, both patients with life-threatening conditions and those seeking routine check-ups can receive the treatment they need in a more time-efficient manner. Furthermore, private medical centers expand the options available to individuals facing medical issues. Given the limited number of government-run hospitals and the growing demand for medical services, prompt access to treatment would be a significant challenge without the presence of these private healthcare providers.\nIn conclusion, while private medical companies do have their shortcomings, such as high costs and limited insurance coverage, I argue that they play a crucial role in delivering quality healthcare services to their targeted clientele."

In my view, the benefits of this development far outweigh the drawbacks.\nFirst and foremost, this trend has significantly broadened our horizons and positively impacted society. One notable advantage is that customers can now access a diverse range of high-quality products while discovering the rich cultures of different countries. Additionally, individuals from economically disadvantaged nations can now access the latest products. For instance, Vietnam may have less advanced manufacturing capabilities compared to America, but thanks to international trade, high-tech devices like laptops and smartphones produced in America are accessible to Vietnamese residents. This access to essential utilities has improved their quality of life.\nAnother advantage is the expansion of the market, which helps prevent monopolistic pricing.

For instance, to attract customers to their flagship product, the iPhone, Samsung regularly innovates the design and functionality of their smartphones.\nIn conclusion, despite some minor criticisms, I believe that globalization has given consumers a significant advantage by providing them with a wide array of options from high-quality producers. I hope that this trend continues to make the world a better place for all of humanity."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that government funding should be prioritized for education and culture over healthcare?",
    "paragraph": "It is widely acknowledged that government funding should contribute to the improvement of society as a whole. However, there is an ongoing debate about which sector should take precedence when it comes to state subsidies. Some argue that the government should offer its citizens free healthcare, while others believe that these funds should be channeled into education and culture. In this essay, we will examine both perspectives before explaining why I support the latter view.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some people propose a healthcare system that is free of charge. The primary reason in favor of this idea is that it would enable more people, particularly those who are financially disadvantaged, to access healthcare services. This, in turn, could lead to a healthier population, which is essential for sustainable economic development. However, this line of thinking has its drawbacks, as the substantial costs associated with running a free healthcare system could strain the government's finances, especially in impoverished and developing nations with limited resources. Overspending on healthcare in these countries could result in insufficient funds for other crucial sectors, such as transportation, which could ultimately hinder their economic growth.\nI align myself with those who argue that instead of fully subsidizing healthcare, the government should invest more in culture and education. Regarding culture, increased financial support in this area can help promote national cultural values globally. This is arguably crucial for boosting the national tourism industry, which could, in turn, generate significant revenues for the government. As for education, additional subsidies can enhance the quality of the educational system, potentially leading to a more educated workforce. This undoubtedly serves as a precursor to a thriving economy in the future. When compared to providing free healthcare, investing in education and culture appears to be a more economically advantageous approach.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons to support the implementation of a free healthcare system, I would argue that it would be wiser to allocate those funds to the fields of education and culture."

    "paragraph": "It is widely believed that violence depicted on television can significantly impact children's tendency toward aggressive behavior. As a result, there have been calls to forbid programs that showcase violent scenes. In this essay, I find this suggestion entirely reasonable, and I aim to explain my perspective.\nTo begin with, opponents of banning violent broadcasts often argue that it may reduce the appeal of such programs, leading to a decrease in viewership. However, this appeal could potentially result in more severe consequences. For instance, young children may develop aggressive tendencies due to excessive exposure to violence on television. This inclination can arguably serve as a breeding ground for increased crime rates, posing a threat to society. To prevent this possible scenario, it is wise to restrict programs that contain violence.\nCertainly, there is an argument that violent films or programs are already required to provide warnings to viewers that such content is unsuitable for those under 18. According to this perspective, it is the responsibility of parents to ensure their children avoid such programs. Nevertheless, it is practically impossible for parents to closely monitor everything their children watch. Therefore, it would be safer to implement a blanket ban on broadcasting violent scenes in the first place.\nIn conclusion, due to the reasons mentioned above, while there are valid arguments against banning TV programs featuring violent scenes, I am convinced that these reasons are largely debatable. Moreover, prohibiting such content can be beneficial in terms of safeguarding children from harmful influences."

    "paragraph": "Television's portrayal of violence is often blamed for influencing children towards aggressive behavior. Consequently, there have been calls to prohibit programs featuring violent scenes. In my view, I wholeheartedly support this idea for the following reasons.\nCritics may argue that eliminating violent scenes would diminish the entertainment value and viewership of the film industry. However, this appeal can lead to severe consequences, including children's exposure to excessive violence, which may nurture misguided perspectives and pose a threat to societal morals. Therefore, prudence must be the foremost consideration when contemplating a ban on televised violence.\nOthers argue that most contemporary movies come with warnings about violence or age appropriateness. According to this perspective, children should learn to choose suitable movies themselves, rather than restricting violent content. Parents, they contend, are responsible for guiding their children's choices and educating them to avoid programs with violent scenes. However, it is challenging for parents to constantly supervise their children to ensure compliance. Hence, implementing a comprehensive prohibition on violence appears to be a safer approach to address this issue.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of banning violent scenes on television, the reasons in favor of such a ban are compelling. Indeed, officially forbidding the depiction of violence on television appears to be the most effective means of protecting children from potential moral degradation."

    "paragraph": "In today's world, the primary concern revolves around maintaining good health, which is paramount in our society. Consequently, some argue that healthcare services should not be controlled by profit-driven corporations. This essay aims to explore both the advantages and disadvantages of private health care, ultimately concluding that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that medical services provided by private companies can be disadvantageous to a certain extent. The first significant drawback is the exorbitant cost associated with private services, rendering them unaffordable for many individuals. To elaborate further, certain advanced equipment like medical imaging machines or analyzers can inflate expenses two to threefold, limiting access to medical care, particularly for those with financial constraints. Another severe consequence is that the pursuit of profits may lead to unethical practices, such as unnecessary medical procedures or overprescribing medication to generate more revenue. This not only erodes the trust between patients and healthcare providers but also jeopardizes public health.\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks of private health care, I am convinced that the benefits of these organizations are more noticeable, supported by a plethora of compelling reasons. The primary rationale is that patients can reap substantial benefits, including shorter waiting times and access to modern healthcare systems. This can be further reinforced by the fact that personalized medical services with private consultants and doctors save patients time during appointments and offer specialized treatment options. Another justification is that private healthcare providers can significantly alleviate the workload of public medical centers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily number of patients surged, overwhelming state hospitals and straining the public healthcare system. However, private healthcare providers stepped in to address these issues by providing additional hospital beds, medical personnel, and testing facilities.\nIn conclusion, while it is indisputable that medical services run by profit-making companies can entail several disadvantages, I contend that these drawbacks are outweighed by the benefits they offer."

    "paragraph": "It is often suggested that schools should prioritize academic success and examination performance, while skills like cooking, dressmaking, and woodwork should be acquired from family and friends. In my view, while academic achievements hold undeniable importance, there is room to include practical life skills within the school curriculum through outdoor activities.\nThere are compelling reasons behind the belief in the significance of academic success and exam results. Firstly, strong academic performance opens doors to numerous university opportunities, increasing the chances of students gaining admission to their preferred institutions. For instance, Vietnamese students can leverage their high school academic records to apply to a variety of universities, improving their prospects of acceptance even before taking the entrance exams. Additionally, schools were originally established with the primary objective of imparting academic knowledge to students, alleviating the need to burden them with the responsibility of acquiring life skills.\nNevertheless, I firmly believe that soft skills and life skills are equally essential for students' future well-being. Firstly, as individuals mature and eventually become independent, they must possess practical skills like cooking and dressmaking to navigate daily life successfully. Such skills equip young adults with the ability to live autonomously without relying on others. Secondly, governments can incorporate outdoor activities into the school curriculum to teach students fundamental life skills, which will prove invaluable in their future endeavors. Furthermore, these activities offer students a much-needed respite from the stress of absorbing copious amounts of academic information.\nIn conclusion, while academic achievements and examination success remain paramount in the realm of education, there is a valid case for integrating life skills into the school curriculum through outdoor activities. This approach ensures that students receive valuable knowledge and capabilities that will serve them well in their future lives."

    "paragraph": "Considering that deciding to have children is one of the most crucial choices in a person's life, an increasing number of individuals are opting to delay parenthood in recent times. This essay aims to elucidate the driving factors behind this trend before asserting that it is indeed a positive development.\nThere are two primary reasons why people are inclined to have children later in life. First and foremost, young individuals today prioritize establishing a successful career. To ensure they can comfortably cover various childcare expenses, such as food, education, and clothing, without experiencing financial strain, many young adults opt to first build a financially stable career. For instance, a prosperous couple would be in a position to provide high-quality necessities and services for their children, thereby facilitating their overall development. Another compelling reason is that individuals aspire to enrich their life experiences through activities such as travel and exposure to different lifestyles, which can enhance their parenting skills.\nI would argue that delaying parenthood offers significant advantages for both families and society. Regarding the former, postponed childbirth increases the likelihood of children being raised in an optimal manner. For example, older parents tend to have greater financial resources at their disposal, enabling them to provide their children with access to prestigious educational institutions. Concerning the latter, postponing childbearing can help mitigate various social issues. This viewpoint is reinforced by the fact that couples who become parents later in life often lead happier and more harmonious lives, which can contribute to a lower divorce rate and, consequently, a decrease in crime and domestic violence.\nIn conclusion, the desire to prioritize building a promising career and enhancing parenting skills underpins this trend.

Some argue that the primary purpose of this endeavor is environmental preservation, while others believe it primarily serves business interests. However, I contend that both viewpoints are valid, and international cooperation can simultaneously benefit both aspects.\nThere are numerous compelling reasons why governments have come together to address pressing global issues, particularly environmental concerns. Firstly, the environment is not the exclusive domain of any single country. When pollution occurs in one region, it inevitably impacts surrounding areas and can even have far-reaching global consequences, potentially becoming a widespread phenomenon. Secondly, environmental challenges are often of a catastrophic nature and necessitate collective efforts from diverse nations. For example, addressing the deterioration of environmental quality in developing countries can be accelerated with the assistance of technological advancements from more developed nations.\nNotwithstanding the advantages mentioned above, international collaboration can also be seen as an opportunity for countries to engage in business expansion. Undoubtedly, this endeavor can broaden the scope of trade beyond domestic boundaries, creating favorable conditions for cross-border transactions. For instance, since Vietnam opened up to the world, numerous business agreements have been forged, enticing corporations from developed countries to invest their resources in this nation. Furthermore, thanks to globalization, many businesses operate subsidiaries worldwide, generating numerous job opportunities for local populations. This not only enhances their quality of life but also bolsters the financial strength of these corporations.\nIn conclusion, international cooperation is a significant trend that holds importance for both the economy and the environment, and thus, it should be actively encouraged."

Personally, I agree with the notion that it is crucial to make the most of the older buildings.\nIt is understandable why tax revenue should be invested in newly constructed buildings. Firstly, renovating an existing structure demands significant government funding and involves considerable efforts, in contrast to the creation of a new one. For instance, when renovating Hue's Ancient Capital, a substantial amount of funds was allocated by state officials for facilities and a multitude of experts to preserve its original beauty. Furthermore, the emergence of modern and unique structures boosts the tourism industry by attracting numerous visitors, thereby contributing to national progress in various aspects.\nDespite the numerous advantages of erecting new buildings mentioned above, I am of the opinion that old structures should be repurposed. To begin with, sustainability is a key factor in favor of reusing these buildings. This is because the process of demolishing and constructing numerous new structures is on the verge of exacerbating environmental problems. Hence, to promote a greener future, utilizing the ancient ones is a more viable option. Additionally, historical events have shaped old architecture, making it a reflection of the nation's unique architectural heritage. This, in turn, instills a sense of cultural appreciation in the younger generation and helps convey traditional values to foreigners.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that government funding should be directed towards ancient buildings due to their positive impact on the environment and their role in fostering a sense of community among residents."

Therefore, the question arises: should healthcare services be operated by profit-seeking companies? Personally, I agree with this idea, but I also recognize the numerous advantages of private healthcare services.\nFirstly, public hospitals in most countries often face issues of overcrowding and insufficient funding. This places immense pressure on doctors, nurses, and patients, as quick recoveries are essential to accommodate more individuals. Opting for private healthcare services can alleviate this burden on the public system, potentially reducing the government's financial burden. Furthermore, those who choose private healthcare can enjoy various benefits, including high-quality and speedy treatments, short waiting times for appointments and surgeries, as well as more comfortable, private facilities.\nHowever, while private healthcare boasts several advantages, it comes with its share of disadvantages. To begin with, private healthcare insurance can be prohibitively expensive, making it unaffordable for many people. Additionally, individuals typically pay monthly premiums, regardless of whether they utilize the system or not. Consequently, many individuals end up paying substantial sums each year for private healthcare services they may never need, which some consider a financial waste. Furthermore, critics argue that private healthcare exacerbates inequality among a nation's citizens, as only the affluent can access the best and quickest treatments available.\nIn conclusion, I believe that as long as governments strive to provide a high standard of healthcare facilities and services for the general public, private healthcare services can coexist and offer numerous advantages that may outweigh the disadvantages."

In my view, the advantages of this trend far outweigh the disadvantages.\nFirst and foremost, this development has expanded our horizons and positively impacted society. One significant benefit is that consumers now have access to a diverse range of high-quality products and the opportunity to explore different cultures from around the world. Moreover, citizens from less affluent nations can now acquire the latest products. For example, Vietnam has a less developed manufacturing sector, while America produces cutting-edge products and facilities.

Instead, people are encouraged to use public transportation like buses, taxis, and the metro on these vehicle-free days. This essay aims to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend and determine whether its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.\nOn one hand, there are some disadvantages to implementing vehicle-free days. Firstly, local residents may experience limited mobility. This means they are restricted to using public transportation, which may not have routes that conveniently connect to their desired destinations. For example, if someone's destination is far from a bus station, they may have to walk a considerable distance to reach it. Furthermore, choosing taxis as an alternative can be expensive compared to using their private vehicles. For instance, a family of four can travel 100km at the cost of a gallon of gasoline in their own car, while commuting the same distance by taxi can amount to several hundred dollars. Secondly, using public transportation on vehicle-free days can result in crowded and sometimes uncomfortable experiences. Commuters have to share the confined space inside public vehicles with many others, which can be distressing, particularly for individuals with claustrophobia. Some people might also face issues such as sexual harassment or unauthorized recording while using public transportation on these days.\nOn the other hand, there are notable advantages to temporarily banning private vehicles in cities. Firstly, governments can make a significant contribution to addressing environmental issues. By prohibiting the use of private vehicles for short periods, there is a substantial reduction in the emission of toxic fumes from vehicles, which helps mitigate the risk of air pollution and maintains a healthier living environment for residents. Additionally, this policy conserves the fuel that would have been used by private vehicles, thus preventing the wastage of natural, non-renewable resources. Furthermore, by promoting the use of public transportation on vehicle-free days, governments can raise awareness among people about eco-friendly travel options, encouraging them to adopt more sustainable modes of commuting. By adjusting their commuting habits, individuals can reduce their ecological footprint, ultimately leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn conclusion, despite the presence of some drawbacks, it is recommended that cities consider implementing vehicle-free days on a permanent basis due to the significant positive effects it has on the environment."

Do you agree or disagree?\"\nImproved Essay:\nWhile some believe that students should engage in homework due to its significance, I acknowledge that this approach may be suitable for many individuals. However, I hold the view that others prioritize extracurricular activities over homework alone.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why assigning homework is beneficial. One key rationale is that it plays a crucial role in helping teachers assess students' abilities and identify those who require additional support. When a student struggles with their math exercises, it signals a need for the teacher to enhance that student's skills. Furthermore, these assignments not only enable students to practice and reinforce lessons from school but also teach them how to create a well-structured plan based on their class schedule and homework load. Most students who organize their work effectively, complete their homework promptly, and exhibit diligence, dedication, and independence are more likely to enjoy a prosperous and successful life.\nOn the other hand, for many students, homework consumes so much time that they are left with insufficient opportunities for extracurricular activities such as sports or socializing with friends. In many families, especially among Asian parents, the prevailing belief is that a focus on academics is the best path to secure a prosperous future with good job prospects. Consequently, students invest the majority of their time in academics, often neglecting the development of essential soft skills, which are highly valuable. This heavy emphasis on homework can result in children having limited interaction with their parents and even feeling intimidated by them. From a certain perspective, homework can deprive children of their childhood and hinder the development of vital interpersonal skills, such as effective communication.\nIn some developed countries like Finland, homework is either optional or nonexistent, allowing students to pursue their interests and passions freely. This approach has proven to be remarkably effective, as people in such countries tend to possess a wide array of life skills and report high levels of happiness.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that homework can be a vital element for many students, particularly those who are enthusiastic about learning or pursuing in-depth studies, it is not the definitive solution for everyone's engagement in social activities. I believe that students in secondary and high school may benefit from homework to enhance their education.

Some believe it's beneficial to expand their personal horizons, while others disagree. This essay argues that despite several disadvantages of international exchange visits for students, they are crucial for their long-term development.\nTo start with, having more exchange opportunities offers numerous benefits. Firstly, students can gain high-quality academic knowledge related to their chosen fields. Learning from distinguished professors from around the world can help students understand and apply these lessons effectively. Additionally, participating in these exchange programs exposes students to innovative developments related to their future careers. For instance, exposure to advanced technology during the manufacturing process can enhance their productivity and reduce expenses. As a result, students develop a deeper understanding and broaden their awareness.\nHowever, it's undeniable that there are significant challenges during student exchange programs that can affect their determination. One of the main challenges is cultural shock. Being unfamiliar with the local culture can hinder the learning process and the formation of new friendships. Moreover, it can disrupt their daily routines for an extended period if not managed properly. Furthermore, being far from their hometown during international exchange visits can lead to a loss of identity. For example, when young individuals embrace a new lifestyle and customs, they may tend to forget or disregard their traditional values. In the long term, many long-standing morals and identities may not endure for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while many students can gain a more positive perspective through global exchange visits, it's true that these experiences can pose a threat to national identities and familiarity with one's home environment.

While detailed planning is undoubtedly crucial, I firmly believe that personal efforts and luck play a more significant role in a successful life.\nThere are two major benefits to having specific plans that play a significant role in achieving favorable outcomes. Firstly, it helps individuals in pursuing their goals. This is because they can set both short-term and long-term objectives with a clear path to motivate them, thus enhancing the execution process. For example, Elon Musk overcame numerous challenges and achieved groundbreaking success with SpaceX due to careful strategic planning. Additionally, detailed planning enables people to stay focused and avoid distractions, which can otherwise hinder their efforts.\nHowever, an alternative perspective suggests that prearranged plans pale in comparison to perseverance and luck. The primary reason for this is that persistence is vital for attaining success. It encourages individuals to acknowledge their limitations and explore alternative paths after encountering unforeseen failures, making them more resilient in overcoming obstacles and pursuing their goals. For instance, Jack Ma tirelessly worked to establish one of China's most successful companies, despite facing various challenges, such as a lack of financial resources. Furthermore, good fortune provides opportunities for growth. It is undeniable that individuals born into affluent families have more chances for personal and career development compared to those from less privileged backgrounds.\nIn conclusion, I believe that both perspectives have their merits.

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that the benefits of international exchange opportunities for students outweigh the drawbacks?",
    "paragraph": "The contentious question of whether young students should have access to numerous global exchange opportunities at their school has been a topic of debate among educationalists. Some argue that it is advantageous to broaden their personal abilities, while others counter this argument. This essay argues that despite several drawbacks of international exchange visits for students, they are essential for their overall development in the long term.\nTo begin with, the availability of more opportunities for exchange visits offers numerous benefits. First and foremost, students can gain high-quality academic knowledge related to their chosen majors. Learning from distinguished lecturers from around the world can help students comprehend and apply these lessons effectively. Additionally, going abroad through these exchange programs exposes students to innovative breakthroughs related to their future careers. For example, exposure to advanced machinery during the manufacturing process can enhance their productivity and reduce necessary expenses. Consequently, students develop a deeper understanding and broaden their awareness.\nConversely, it is undeniable that there are significant challenges during student exchange programs that can hinder their determination. Chief among these is the cultural shock. Being unfamiliar with the local culture can impede the learning process and hinder the formation of new friendships. Moreover, it can disrupt their daily routines for an extended period if not managed properly. Furthermore, being far away from their hometown during international exchange visits can lead to a loss of identity. For instance, when young individuals embrace a new lifestyle and customs, they may tend to forget or disregard their traditional values. In the long term, many long-standing morals and identities may not endure for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while many students can gain a more positive perspective through global exchange visits, it is true that these experiences can pose a threat to national identities and familiarity with one's home environment. From my perspective, each student should carefully plan to mitigate any unexpected consequences in order to fully utilize the advantages of international exchange visits."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that the advantages of private healthcare outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "paragraph": "In today's world, maintaining good health is of paramount importance to everyone in society. Consequently, some argue that healthcare services should not be controlled by profit-oriented corporations. This essay aims to examine both the advantages and disadvantages of private healthcare, ultimately concluding that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that medical services provided by private companies can have some disadvantages. One significant drawback is the exorbitant cost associated with private healthcare services, making them unaffordable for many individuals. To elaborate further, the speed and state-of-the-art equipment of these services can drive up the expenses, limiting access to medical care, particularly for those with financial constraints. Another serious concern is that profit-driven decisions may lead to unethical practices in healthcare. For instance, in profit-oriented healthcare systems, financial considerations may take precedence over patient needs, potentially resulting in over-treatment or unnecessary medical procedures.\nHowever, despite these drawbacks, I am convinced that the advantages of private healthcare organizations outweigh these disadvantages for several compelling reasons. Firstly, patients can benefit greatly from shorter waiting times and modern healthcare systems. This is reinforced by the fact that private healthcare services can offer personalized consultations with doctors, helping patients save time on appointments and receive specialized treatment. Another justification is that private healthcare can alleviate the workload of public medical centers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the number of patients seeking medical attention, overwhelming state hospitals and burdening the public healthcare system. Private healthcare services can play a vital role in addressing such situations.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that medical services operated by profit-making companies can have several disadvantages, I maintain that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that imprisonment is a more effective solution than education to prevent crimes?",
    "paragraph": "Imprisonment is often considered a more effective solution than education to prevent crimes. In my opinion, although investing in educational resources can lower crime rates to a certain extent, severe punishments still play a more crucial role in surmounting this persistent problem.\nProponents of education argue for its positive impact on society in the long term. The motives for criminal activity are often deeply rooted in underlying factors, ranging from poverty to a lack of access to formal education. Therefore, governments can allocate funds to ensure free and accessible education for individuals from impoverished backgrounds, improving their chances of obtaining well-paid jobs. There is anecdotal evidence that in countries with low crime rates, such as Singapore and Canada, the general population has easy access to education and is thus less likely to resort to criminal means for support.\nHowever, imprisonment is justifiable as it best ensures public safety. Firstly, criminals cannot continue committing crimes when they are serving sentences in jails. Isolating criminals is the best way to protect society for extended periods, especially in cases of convicted murderers, rapists, kidnappers, and other serious offenses, eliminating even the slightest chance these criminals will continue to harm other individuals. Sentencing criminals to prisons can also effectively deter criminal acts. Those with the intention of engaging in illegal activities will naturally have to consider the risk of potentially losing their freedom. This is exemplified in nations with severe sentencing laws, such as Vietnam, where the government sentences illegal drug traffickers to life imprisonment and has successfully reduced the number of drug-related incidents as a result.\nIn conclusion, while educational provision can partially reduce crime rates, putting offenders in jails is by far the most effective form of deterrence. Governments should naturally combine both methods to achieve the most desirable outcomes."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that a person's true worth should be determined by their character rather than external factors such as social standing and material possessions?",
    "paragraph": "In today's contemporary society, there is a prevalent belief that a person's value is often assessed based on their social standing and material possessions. Consequently, qualities like ethics, integrity, and wisdom are no longer held in high regard. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that an individual's true worth should be determined by their character rather than external factors. This essay will elaborate on the key points supporting this notion.\nTo begin with, social status and wealth do not contribute significantly to long-term personal growth. This is because class and monetary wealth are contingent upon individuals' efforts to accumulate and maintain them. However, not all individuals in privileged positions can sustain their status if they lack the requisite abilities and the approval of the people around them. Furthermore, it is predicted that in the near future, currency may become obsolete due to improved living conditions for residents. According to Karl Marx, after the era of capitalism, the world will transition into socialism, guaranteeing a contented life for citizens, rendering the concepts of money and social classes unnecessary.\nDelving deeper into this notion, it can be persuasively argued that human qualities play a pivotal role in achieving success. When an individual consistently treats others with kindness and offers help to the best of their abilities, they are likely to receive support from those they have assisted, expediting their path to success. Consequently, they earn praise and respect from their peers and reap financial rewards from their achievements.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that human virtues should be universally acknowledged as the true criteria for evaluating a person's worth. Therefore, individuals should prioritize nurturing their good conduct and attitudes to become exemplary citizens."

    "paragraph": "Workforce competition between older and younger individuals vying for the same jobs is currently a noteworthy concern. In my view, this phenomenon can have unfavorable implications for the labor market. Therefore, it is crucial for governments and companies to take action to address these issues.\nThe rising rate of unemployment among the youth, which can result from the aforementioned trend, is a significant concern. Younger workers, with less experience, may encounter challenges in distinguishing themselves and gaining recognition comparable to their older counterparts, who are generally perceived as more experienced. Consequently, youth unemployment can lead to social issues, such as homelessness and juvenile delinquency. Furthermore, as individuals age, their health may deteriorate, potentially limiting their capacity to handle multiple tasks and requiring greater mental focus, which can result in reduced productivity.\nTo address the problem of youth unemployment, businesses should actively promote more internship opportunities for less experienced young employees. In Vietnam, numerous universities have established partnerships with businesses that offer apprenticeships or exchange programs to help students enhance their skills. By gaining practical knowledge through these initiatives, students can significantly increase their chances of securing employment. Another effective approach is to improve the quality of life for the elderly by implementing comprehensive welfare programs. For instance, instead of relying on employment for healthcare expenses, the elderly can receive healthcare services from the government, including home visits and outpatient rehabilitation services.\nIn conclusion, intergenerational competition for employment opportunities can lead to youth unemployment and reduced productivity. This underscores the importance of collaboration between the government and private companies to address these challenges."

    "paragraph": "Sports and leisure activities serve not only as a means of physical exercise but also as a source of entertainment and relaxation for individuals and communities alike. Therefore, some people argue that a sport as extreme as boxing is inappropriate in the modern age due to the physical injuries it frequently inflicts upon its participants. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this viewpoint for several reasons.\nTo begin with, it is undeniable that boxing matches showcased in the media often emphasize moral principles and provide a spectacle that includes respect for opponents, adherence to rules, and fair play. However, underground boxing, which appeals to a particular audience, is often marred by disturbing elements such as foul language, disregard for opponents, violent punches, brutal scenes, and an unseemly appearance resulting from intense physical contact. Consequently, this perilous sport is ill-suited to exist in today's world.\nAnother compelling reason supporting my agreement with this perspective is the case of Mike Tyson, a prominent American boxer with numerous noteworthy accomplishments in his career. As Tyson grew older, he began to suffer from serious health issues stemming from his past boxing matches, including osteoporosis and vision-related problems. Furthermore, scientific studies on Tyson's health indicated that he was unlikely to fully recover from the injuries incurred during his boxing career, exacerbated by the natural aging process. In this context, I would argue that this hazardous sport poses a significant threat to the physical well-being of its participants and should be banned on safety grounds.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that eliminating boxing is a reasonable and responsible course of action due to the detrimental impact it has on the physical health of its athletes."

The level of copper in the blood, which includes both ceruloplasmin-bound and non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper, is typically low when WD is diagnosed in non-acute cases. However, in WD-related ALF, it is likely to be high because non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper is released from the failing liver. Additionally, urinary copper production should be very high. When examining the liver tissue through a biopsy, we often observe multi-lobular confluent necrosis, which is consistently present alongside cirrhosis.

    "paragraph": "Some argue that music serves only as a source of entertainment for humans, while others believe that its role extends beyond mere amusement and holds a significant position in society. This essay will explore both perspectives and explain why music should not be reduced to a mere form of entertainment.\nThose who believe that music is solely for entertainment often point to the way it is consumed in our daily lives. Indeed, a considerable number of people now tend to prefer songs that follow a predictable formula and provide instant gratification, without delving into deeper meanings. This has resulted in an inundation of repetitive and clich?d music that enjoys popularity among listeners but frequently faces criticism from experts. A prime example of this phenomenon can be observed in K-pop, one of the world's largest music industries, which has been criticized for heavily following trends and fads, potentially leading to a lack of originality in both music and performances.\nHowever, music also serves as a powerful tool for conveying essential messages and challenging stereotypes. Singers and composers can use their music to express their viewpoints and garner support from fans who share their beliefs. For instance, \"Beds are Burning\" by Midnight Oil, focusing on land rights and the mistreatment of Indigenous communities by white Australians, became a global sensation upon its release. It was one of the pioneering songs that raised awareness about racism and inspired others to advocate for a more equitable society through their lyrics and melodies. Examples of such socially conscious music include \"None of Us Are Free,\" \"Drowning,\" and \"The Killing Season.\"\nIn conclusion, music has the ability to break down barriers and challenge misconceptions while promoting social equality, making it much more than a source of pleasure in society."

There is an ongoing debate about whether governments or private companies should oversee medical services. In my view, I completely agree that governments should be responsible for medical services, and this essay will explain why.\nFirst and foremost, when governments are in charge of medical systems, everyone has an equal opportunity to access healthcare, regardless of their financial situation. To illustrate, in some cases, like in the USA, when private companies took control of medical services from the government, the prices for services such as general check-ups and surgeries increased significantly. Consequently, it has become financially burdensome for people to seek medical treatment.\nSecondly, if private companies manage medical services, private health insurance becomes essential to cover the high costs. Moreover, intense competition among health insurance companies is likely to drive prices up. Lastly, governments can ensure that hospitals are evenly distributed across the country. In contrast, private companies tend to establish hospitals only in bustling cities, as it is challenging to generate profits in smaller, quieter towns.\nIn conclusion, there are several compelling reasons why medical services should be administered by governments. They can provide equitable access to healthcare, regardless of a person's wealth or location. Additionally, private insurance should remain optional rather than mandatory for receiving medical services."

From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint due to the significance of both aspects for several reasons.\nOn one hand, there are compelling reasons why the outward appearance holds paramount importance. Firstly, it is crucial to ensure that a building complies with government regulations. In various residential areas, authorities often mandate uniform architectural styles to maintain a harmonious community environment. This approach contributes to the overall comfort and cohesion of society. Furthermore, numerous recreational establishments prioritize attractive designs to entice customers. For instance, most shopping centers invest in appealing aesthetics to draw in shoppers. Thanks to their pleasing appearances, they can increase their revenue and enhance their reputation.\nOn the other hand, it is evident that functionality also plays a vital role in constructing a building. Firstly, it greatly contributes to the safety of the building's occupants. One of the most crucial functions is ensuring the house's sustainability, creating a secure living environment for its residents. Secondly, a well-thought-out functional design allows family members to carry out their daily routines with ease. For example, in densely populated urban areas, spacious residences covering a substantial area often cater to the preferences of a majority of the population.\nIn conclusion, while there is an ongoing debate regarding whether function or outward appearance takes precedence in building design, I believe that both aspects are indispensable factors in creating the ideal dwelling."

    "paragraph": "In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of people learning foreign languages. Some argue that the sole purpose of acquiring these languages is for traveling to other countries or improving one's chances of finding work abroad. However, others contend that there are broader reasons for learning a foreign language. This essay will explore both perspectives before offering my own viewpoint on the matter.\nUndoubtedly, being proficient in multiple languages can indeed be valuable for those who wish to travel abroad or seek employment in foreign countries. The most obvious advantage is the potential to reduce the likelihood of miscommunications or misunderstandings while traveling or working in a foreign environment. Additionally, many international companies require their employees to be fluent in languages other than their native tongue, particularly English. Consequently, individuals with language proficiency may have an edge in securing financially rewarding positions, which can significantly improve their quality of life by ensuring the ability to meet their basic needs and personal interests.\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that the benefits of learning a foreign language extend far beyond these practical advantages. One significant benefit is the enhancement of global mutual understanding. In today's interconnected world, people from different countries often engage in face-to-face interactions. Proficiency in a common language, such as English, can help bridge language barriers and promote better communication, ultimately fostering international friendships.\nAnother notable advantage is the opportunity to gain a deeper and broader understanding of various cultures and histories. It is undeniable that a significant portion of the world's history and culture is recorded in widely spoken languages. Consequently, individuals who excel in these languages can gain profound insights into the cultures and histories associated with them, which can be highly beneficial if they decide to live in or engage with these nations.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that learning a foreign language for the sole purpose of traveling or working abroad can offer certain advantages, it is evident that the benefits of acquiring foreign languages for various purposes are undeniable. Learning a new language not only facilitates practical matters like travel and employment but also fosters global understanding and enriches one's knowledge of different cultures and histories. Therefore, it is advisable to consider these broader benefits when deciding to embark on a journey of language acquisition."

    "paragraph": "Some people hold the view that preserving wild animals is a futile endeavor in the 21st century, arguing that these creatures offer little to no benefit to our progress. However, I respectfully disagree with this perspective, and I firmly believe that we should continue to protect wild animals due to their valuable contributions to our world.\nFirstly, the presence of wild animals plays a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. When a species nears extinction, it disrupts the delicate web of life, causing cascading effects on other organisms. For instance, the European Bison plays a pivotal role in regulating vegetation growth in its habitat. If the Bison were to disappear, the floristic composition of their environment would suffer, potentially triggering various problems related to climate change. Additionally, wild animals in their natural habitats contribute to enhancing soil health and fertility. Certain animals, such as hippos, actively improve soil conditions through their digging activities, enriching the mineral content of the soil.\nFurthermore, the preservation of wild animals is essential for advancing medical research. Despite our advanced medical and technological capabilities, some drugs and vaccines still require experimentation on animals due to their shared biological characteristics with humans. Animal testing has resulted in numerous life-saving cures and treatments, including breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases like breast cancer and brain injuries.\nIn conclusion, taking into account the aforementioned factors, the conservation of wild animals remains of utmost importance because of their roles in ecological balance, soil health, and scientific research. It is in our best interest to coexist harmoniously with wild animals, contributing to a more peaceful and stable world for all."

In my perspective, I firmly concur with this notion for the following reasons.\nTo commence, money plays a pivotal role in sustaining one's livelihood. The cost of living in urban and coastal regions has escalated significantly in recent decades. Take Vietnam, for instance, where room rents have surged from mere hundreds in the 2000s to millions by 2010, with further increases anticipated. Consequently, individuals are compelled to exert more effort in order to afford their accommodations. A poignant example is a female teacher in Vietnam who reluctantly abandoned her cherished profession due to financial distress. When asked about her salary, she welled up with tears, lamenting that the meager income could not cover her bills or provide for her children. In summary, it is evident that in this era of soaring living costs, a substantial salary outweighs job satisfaction.\nFurthermore, a generous income serves as a potent motivator, regardless of the nature of one's occupation. Money is perceived as a powerful incentive, propelling individuals to perform at their best. Upon completing their education, graduates invariably seek positions that offer the desired remuneration, regardless of the job's demands. Consequently, when offered a substantial salary, individuals are inclined to work diligently, alleviating their financial burdens. Additionally, well-compensated employees are more likely to remain in the workforce for extended periods. This, in turn, contributes to a greater number of active workers, increased production of goods and services, and an overall enhancement of living standards and economic prosperity.\nIn conclusion, a profession that provides a substantial income undeniably holds greater appeal than one that solely caters to inner satisfaction.

I firmly believe that having ambition is essential, and it is a favorable trait when practiced within reasonable boundaries.\nIt is essential to recognize that harboring specific ambitions provides individuals with a sense of purpose in life. This is evident in the behavior of unemployed individuals who, when contentedly living off unemployment benefits, often feel aimless and end up engaging in unproductive activities like prolonged television watching, gossiping, or even committing minor crimes like vandalism. These activities ultimately lead to trouble for themselves, their families, and their communities as a whole. However, sociologists, psychologists, and psychoanalysts have definitively demonstrated that when such individuals set concrete goals for themselves, they can often transform their lives and become productive contributors to society. This underscores the significance of striving to attain specific achievements or milestones in one's life.\nI am convinced that ambition is generally a positive characteristic when employed sensibly. While there are cases where some individuals pursue unattainable goals, resulting in mental and physical exhaustion, psychological issues such as anxiety and depression, diminished self-esteem, and even suicidal thoughts, such instances are exceptions. Under normal circumstances, where ambition is channeled responsibly, it motivates individuals to aim for excellence and achieve more in life. For instance, students aspiring to excel in their studies tend to be more focused and achieve better academic results than their less academically driven peers. Similarly, athletes with aspirations to break world records in their respective sports have heightened motivation to practice and compete. Even if they do not ultimately establish new world records, their skills generally far surpass those who lack such ambitious aspirations. These examples, among countless others, highlight the positive outcomes that arise from pursuing ambitious life goals.\nIn conclusion, it is of paramount importance that individuals set specific objectives for themselves in life, and ambition is primarily a commendable personal quality, particularly when harnessed appropriately."

While this development brings certain advantages, I believe that its drawbacks are more significant.\nAdmittedly, the growing popularity of traveling to remote areas can offer some significant benefits. From a scientific perspective, researchers who venture into these untouched and pristine places contribute immensely to making scientific breakthroughs. These regions provide specialized researchers with not only exotic and diverse flora and fauna systems but also a wealth of precious minerals and metals, which can aid in the development of human society. Additionally, for visitors, it is conceivable that they can gain a once-in-a-lifetime traveling experience. By escaping the hustle and bustle of their urban environments and immersing themselves in natural surroundings, they can develop a deep appreciation for nature and raise public awareness about the importance of preserving wildlife.\nHowever, despite these advantages, I believe that the disadvantages of traveling to remote areas are more significant. Firstly, the gradual decline in the population of elusive species can disrupt the ecosystem. Hunting is a prime example of this. Scientists conducting animal experiments often catch and cause the death of animals, which aids in their scientific research. However, this practice can lead to the loss of the inherent natural beauty of these species. Another significant drawback is the potential danger faced by those who visit these areas without a deep understanding of the geography and new habitats.

Although this perspective has some merit, I believe that people should be allowed to take part in these activities as long as certain safety precautions are in place.\nIt's understandable why some people argue for government restrictions on extreme sports. The main reason behind this is the inherent danger associated with these exciting recreational activities. For instance, these intense games can pose serious risks to players' physical well-being in the long term, such as bone fractures, head trauma, and even life-threatening injuries in the worst-case scenarios. Another argument in favor of prohibiting risky sports is that it perpetuates social inequality. This is evident when we consider that only a small proportion of the population with abundant financial resources can afford to participate. The high costs involved, including participation fees and insurance expenses, discourage ordinary individuals with modest incomes from engaging in these activities.\nDespite the arguments supporting the need for governments to ban dangerous sports, I believe that adventurous individuals should be given the opportunity to engage in these activities under certain conditions, such as close supervision and the use of protective equipment. This is because, with the right gear and thorough examination by specialized experts, the likelihood of serious injuries can be significantly reduced. Additionally, professional athletes who have undergone rigorous training with their coaches can participate in official competitions, as they have been properly instructed and understand the risks involved. By doing so, they can pursue their passion and be rewarded with certificates of merit, medals, and even cash prizes, which serve as incentives for them to strive for international recognition.\nIn conclusion, while there are compelling arguments for a complete ban on extreme sports based on safety concerns, I believe that governments should authorize well-qualified participants who take sensible precautions.

Balancing expenditures between defense and social benefits is a critical aspect of this responsibility. I firmly believe that prioritizing defense spending over social benefits is essential, and I will elucidate several reasons for this stance in this essay.\nA larger defense budget can yield positive results in curbing terrorism and controlling illegal immigration. Firstly, numerous terrorist organizations have perpetrated deadly attacks worldwide in recent decades, claiming the lives of innocent civilians. For instance, the tragic events of September 11, 2001, stand as a poignant example of a terrorist attack that resulted in the tragic loss of thousands of lives. Furthermore, illegal immigration has adverse effects on both the economy and society, with a significant portion of the national budget being expended on education, healthcare, and housing for undocumented immigrants. Consequently, converting social welfare spending into defense funds can help prevent terrorists and illegal immigrants from entering the country, addressing these pressing issues.\nOn the other hand, social welfare programs impose various taxes on citizens, which can have negative repercussions. Many families aspire to own a home, but the soaring house prices make this dream increasingly unattainable, primarily due to high housing taxes. Consequently, a substantial increase in homelessness among citizens becomes evident as housing becomes less affordable.\nIn conclusion, it is imperative for governments to allocate more resources to defense while reducing spending on social benefits to fulfill their responsibility of safeguarding national security. Terrorism and illegal immigration are compelling reasons to support this viewpoint.

Firstly, the widespread use of digital platforms, particularly among the younger generation, has led to people becoming socially isolated from their loved ones. Numerous entertainment platforms have piqued people's interest and absorbed their attention. An illustrative example of this trend can be observed among many young people in Vietnam, who prefer immersing themselves in the cyber world, such as Tik Tok and Facebook, rather than devoting time to engage in conversations or interact with their families.\nSecondly, people often find themselves caught up in demanding work schedules, working overtime or even night shifts to support their livelihoods. As a result, they struggle to find time for personal commitments, let alone spending time with their family members.\nFurthermore, differences in generational stereotypes and conflicts between age groups can lead to a lack of understanding, causing one generation to be less sympathetic towards the problems of another. This generation gap can result in disputes and make life less enjoyable for all parties involved.\nThe trend of spending less time with loved ones can have several implications for individuals and families alike. Individuals who are not close to their families are more likely to choose solitary lifestyles and may experience mental health issues such as depression and anxiety disorders. Without quality time spent together, families may drift apart, leading to misunderstandings and even conflicts.\nIn conclusion, the increase in spending less time with family members can be attributed to personal entertainment choices, demanding work schedules, and generational differences. Ultimately, this trend has negative effects on both individuals' well-being and society as a whole."

    "question": "To what extent do the advantages of using computers in primary and secondary education outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "paragraph": "In today's world, there is a debate surrounding the role of computers in primary and secondary education. Some argue that computers enhance the educational experience, making it more enjoyable and effective for students, while others are concerned that excessive reliance on computers can have negative physical and emotional consequences for students. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and share my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why digital tools can aid students in their studies. Firstly, computers provide students with access to a vast amount of information. For example, when they encounter difficulties or confusion, they can search for answers on the Internet with a high degree of accuracy, even without the immediate assistance of teachers. Secondly, students can attend virtual lessons through computer screens. This not only ensures the quality of instruction but also saves a significant amount of time and money that would otherwise be spent on commuting.\nOn the other hand, some argue that prolonged exposure to computers can lead to potential health issues and hinder the development of essential life skills. Specifically, excessive computer use, without sufficient interaction with peers and the real world, can weaken students' eyesight and make them less adept at handling complex, real-life problems. However, if students use digital devices responsibly and are guided and supported by their parents, many of these adverse effects can be mitigated and corrected. Therefore, the benefits of computers in education are likely to outweigh the drawbacks.\nIn conclusion, the use of computers in education has become increasingly prevalent, with both supporters and detractors presenting valid arguments. In my view, I wholeheartedly support the idea that students can have a more enjoyable and efficient learning experience through the use of high-quality digital tools."

    "question": "To what extent should parents be responsible for teaching their children how to be responsible members of society?",
    "paragraph": "Some individuals hold the belief that parents should play a crucial role in imparting the values of being a responsible member of our community to their children. Conversely, there is an opposing viewpoint that argues for schools as the primary institutions for instilling such knowledge. In my view, I align with the former perspective as I believe that the family serves as the foundation for each individual, and caregivers should be the ones to instill this vital knowledge.\nOn one hand, schools are indeed appropriate venues for educating students, as they not only offer a wide range of academic knowledge but also equip young learners with essential life skills necessary to become responsible citizens. To be more specific, the government in Vietnam, recognizing the significance of imparting fundamental life skills alongside academic education, has implemented practical strategies to encourage teachers nationwide to provide additional life lessons. As a result, students can acquire not only critical skills but also engage in engaging lessons, thereby enhancing their concentration.\nOn the other hand, some argue that the instruction on becoming good members of society at school may be overly theoretical and disconnected from real-life experiences. Instead, acquiring these essential skills at home can prove to be more advantageous for children. For instance, the home environment is an ideal setting for parents to educate their offspring about being responsible members of society since parents are more intimately connected to their children than anyone else. Consequently, they possess a deeper understanding of their children's unique characteristics and can tailor their guidance to address weaknesses and bolster strengths effectively.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that schools offer students a wealth of valuable information. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that children are better served when their parents take an active role in educating them about how to become exemplary members of our society."

    "question": "Why do young people today tend to be more familiar with international pop and movie stars than with renowned historical figures in their own country?",
    "paragraph": "Many young people today possess a greater familiarity with famous individuals from the entertainment industry, such as international pop and movie stars, rather than renowned historical figures within their own nation. This essay aims to identify the primary factors contributing to this phenomenon, namely the influence of media and uninspiring teaching methods, and then propose a more effective approach to address this issue.\nThis trend can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the media plays a pivotal role in this preference, as it consistently highlights information about well-known celebrities due to their current prominence in society. Consequently, young individuals, who naturally have a curiosity about current events, are drawn to these popular figures who are prominently featured in the media on a daily basis. Moreover, this inclination is further exacerbated by the conventional teaching methods employed in history education. Typically, history is presented in a traditional manner, involving the rote memorization of dates and events, which fails to ignite students' interest in historical personalities and their contributions. In essence, educators often emphasize the memorization of historical events and timelines as the cornerstone of historical learning, perpetuating a fixed and outdated teaching approach.\nA viable solution to this issue involves encouraging educational institutions to incorporate innovative teaching methods into their curricula. Instead of relying solely on conventional approaches, educational videos and visual aids should be integrated into lectures to captivate students' interest in history. This approach can foster an engaging learning environment, leading to significantly improved academic outcomes. For instance, in addition to providing background information about historical events, such as significant victories or pivotal battles, educational materials can include images of the leaders or individuals who played pivotal roles in these historical events. This visual approach enables students to gain a comprehensive understanding of historical events by connecting them with the individuals who shaped the course of history.\nIn conclusion, the growing disparity between young people's knowledge of international pop or movie stars and their ignorance of historical figures is a genuine concern. This phenomenon is primarily driven by the influence of the media and the uninspiring teaching methods used in history education. However, there is a promising solution to this issue: the implementation of more engaging and interactive teaching techniques that can rekindle students' interest in their nation's history."

    "paragraph": "It is believed by some that online learning will eventually replace traditional face-to-face learning. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.\nFirstly, individuals engaged in face-to-face study have the valuable opportunity to interact with their teacher in real-time. During in-person learning sessions, questions receive immediate responses, whereas online learning often requires waiting for answers. Research indicates that face-to-face learning yields better academic performance than e-learning. The dynamic interaction between educators and students lies at the heart of the educational process.\nSecondly, face-to-face learning cultivates focused attention among learners. In contrast, online learning can easily lead to boredom, as learners tend to be more passive, primarily listening. In physical classrooms, educators can engage students in various interactive activities that encourage active learning. For instance, students are typically not allowed to use smartphones unless permitted by their teachers, and educators can closely observe and monitor their students. Conversely, online learners may become distracted by private interests, like texting friends or playing games. Consequently, this can hinder their educational progress.\nThirdly, in-person learning offers opportunities to acquire vital skills through classes and extracurricular activities such as clubs, including communication skills, presentation skills, and problem-solving skills. The classroom serves as a microcosm of society, bringing together a diverse group of individuals who learn together. Consequently, direct learning not only imparts specialized knowledge but also hones essential soft skills, such as building new friendships and working collaboratively in groups. Therefore, learners benefit not only from their teachers but also from the diverse perspectives of their classmates.\nIn conclusion, while online learning certainly presents advantages, it is not sufficiently compelling to entirely replace traditional face-to-face learning. Consequently, in-person learning remains an effective and valuable educational approach in the long run."

    "question": "Should university students be free to choose courses that align with their personal interests, or should they be limited to studying subjects with potential future benefits?",
    "paragraph": "Some individuals argue that university students should be free to choose courses that align with their personal interests. In contrast, others assert that they should be limited to studying subjects with potential future benefits, particularly those related to science and technology. While I understand the reasoning behind supporting the latter perspective, I personally favor the former viewpoint.\nOn one hand, proponents of narrowing the range of subjects available to students have valid reasons. From their standpoint, a restricted selection of courses can enhance a student's focus, potentially leading to more efficient learning and a shorter duration of study. For example, students exclusively focusing on compulsory subjects are likely to graduate sooner than those who pursue their own preferences. Another aspect to consider is that concentrating on a narrower set of subjects is less challenging than covering a wide array of topics, which can potentially result in improved average scores.\nOn the other hand, I align with those who believe students should have the freedom to study subjects they are passionate about. One significant reason for this is that when students genuinely engage with their chosen subjects, they tend to acquire a broader knowledge base compared to those who exclusively focus on specific disciplines. Consequently, this expanded knowledge can create more career opportunities for them. Another crucial advantage is their increased adaptability, stemming from their diverse knowledge base. This adaptability makes it easier for them to find jobs that align with their interests. For instance, recent graduates with a broad knowledge base can readily adapt to various roles and have better prospects for career advancement.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the reasons behind advocating for students to study only subjects with future utility, I remain firm in my belief that students should be granted the freedom to choose their courses based on their personal interests."

    "paragraph": "People have differing opinions on whether reading can enhance individuals' imagination and language skills more effectively than watching TV. While there are advantages to watching TV, I would argue that reading offers a wide range of benefits for individuals.\nOn the one hand, television serves as both entertainment and a source of educational content for children. Primarily, people tend to turn to TV after work or school to relax and improve their ability to depict real-life scenarios vividly. For example, children can explore different perspectives on the world through children's programs on TV, which provide them with a unique lens through which to view the world. However, it's worth noting that many advertisements can be distracting and annoying for viewers during programs. These ads are typically purchased by businesses aiming to convey as much product information as possible without considering viewers' feedback.\nOn the other hand, reading for pleasure can aid individuals in nurturing their imagination and enhancing their language skills in several ways. One rationale behind this is that reading stimulates the brain, requiring readers to employ their imagination to visualize the story's characters and settings. Additionally, reading can promote critical and creative thinking, improve logical reasoning, and contribute to the development of creative and intelligent individuals. Another point to emphasize is that reading can significantly boost language skills by expanding one's vocabulary and writing abilities. For example, toddlers who engage in daily reading activities can enhance their reading comprehension skills and better understand fairy tales compared to their peers.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons why people may prefer watching TV, I firmly believe that reading offers individuals numerous potential benefits in their lives."

    "question": "To what extent do increased financial stability and the desire for new possessions contribute to the trend of discarding old belongings?",
    "paragraph": "In our modern society, some individuals choose to discard old belongings rather than preserving and reusing them as was the practice in the past. This shift can be attributed to two primary factors: increased financial stability and the desire for new possessions. While there are certain advantages to this change, it also brings about various impacts on people's attitudes.\nOne of the primary reasons behind the transition towards not retaining outdated items is the improved financial situation of individuals. Nowadays, people earn more money than they did in the past, thanks to their jobs and additional sources of income. This financial stability allows them to purchase new clothing and household items without much concern. For instance, if parents notice that their children's clothing has become soiled and torn, they readily purchase new outfits for their sons or daughters.\nThe second reason contributing to this shift is the desire to possess new items. In today's world, the influence of social media has grown at an unprecedented rate, with most people using it daily. Consequently, individuals are exposed to the lifestyles of others more frequently. When they see their friends acquiring new cars, smart devices, or household items, they often experience a sense of envy, prompting them to make similar purchases.\nTurning to the effects of this change on people's behavior, both positive and negative consequences emerge. On the positive side, people's inclination to discard outdated possessions rather than reusing or recycling them indicates that they are living more comfortably and earning money more easily than in the past. However, on the negative side, this behavior signifies a lack of attention to savings. Not only are individuals neglecting the proper care of their belongings, but they are also squandering their resources unnecessarily. Consequently, if this trend continues unchecked, people may become increasingly wasteful in their spending habits.\nIn conclusion, the tendency to abandon outdated possessions is driven by increased financial stability and the desire for new acquisitions, often influenced by social comparisons. This change has both positive and negative effects on people's behavior, illustrating the need for a balanced approach to consumption and financial management."

    "paragraph": "It is indeed a fact that some individuals who have committed crimes may repeat their offenses even after facing punishment. While there are various reasons behind this concerning trend, governments can adopt certain effective measures to address this issue.\nThere are primarily two reasons why repeat offenders may persist in criminal behavior. Firstly, the penalties imposed on them may not be stringent enough. For instance, in some countries, theft is associated with a relatively lenient punishment, which contributes to a high rate of re-offending among thieves. Secondly, in today's competitive job market, adults must possess qualifications and skills to secure employment. Ex-prisoners often lack the necessary skills or qualifications, making it exceptionally challenging for them to find suitable work. Consequently, they may resort to criminal activities as a means of earning income, as it appears to be the most accessible option for them.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, both governments and individuals need to take action. Firstly, governments should enact and enforce stricter laws to make offenders comprehend the adverse consequences of their actions. Additionally, rehabilitation plays a pivotal role in encouraging offenders to acquire essential life skills, thereby better preparing them for reintegration into society. For example, within the prison system, they can gain practical skills such as computer programming, automobile maintenance, and construction. Furthermore, it is crucial for offenders to acknowledge their wrongdoing and demonstrate a sincere commitment to turning their lives around.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that lenient punishments and the lack of skills are the primary factors contributing to recidivism.

For instance, many young people enjoy visiting museums and art galleries to capture photos of exhibitions. This allows them to temporarily escape the hustle and bustle of urban life. Additionally, museums offer a serene environment where young individuals can engage in recreational activities, such as interactive AI programs that bring historical figures to life or virtual reality experiences that enable them to immerse themselves in historical eras.

    "paragraph": "In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of people learning new languages. Some argue that the sole purpose of learning a foreign language is for travel or to improve employment prospects in foreign countries. However, others believe that there are more reasons to learn a foreign language beyond these practical aspects. This essay will explore both perspectives before presenting my own opinion on the matter.\nUndoubtedly, being proficient in multiple languages can offer significant advantages when it comes to traveling abroad or seeking employment opportunities in foreign countries. The most prominent benefit is the potential reduction in communication barriers and increased job prospects. It is a well-established fact that many international companies require their employees to be fluent in multiple languages, particularly in widely spoken languages like English. This proficiency can greatly enhance one's chances of securing financially rewarding jobs, ultimately contributing to a more secure and prosperous life. This is because a good income can cover essential needs and allow for the pursuit of personal interests.\nNevertheless, the advantages of learning a foreign language go beyond these practical benefits. Firstly, it fosters greater global understanding and cooperation. In our increasingly interconnected world, people from different countries often engage in face-to-face interactions. Proficiency in a common global language can help bridge linguistic gaps, reduce misunderstandings, and promote international friendships. Moreover, it allows individuals to delve deeper into the richness of diverse cultures and histories. It is a well-known fact that much of the world's history and culture is documented in widely spoken languages. Therefore, those who excel in these languages can gain profound insights into various cultures and histories, potentially enriching their lives, especially if they choose to live in these regions.\nIn conclusion, while learning a foreign language solely for the purpose of travel or work can be advantageous, it is clear that the benefits of learning foreign languages for various purposes are undeniable. It not only opens doors to better job opportunities and easier international travel but also promotes global understanding and provides access to the richness of different cultures and histories. Learning a foreign language can truly be a rewarding endeavor with multifaceted advantages."

Consequently, health concerns and strategies for leading a healthier life have garnered widespread attention. I firmly believe that it is essential for everyone to possess a good understanding of their health. In my view, maintaining a healthy lifestyle and minimizing the risk of disease largely hinges on a well-rounded approach that includes a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and a proper rest routine.\nIn this era of globalization, people are becoming increasingly busy, and a significant portion of the population tends to underestimate the health risks they face. Many opt for fast food over balanced meals. However, it's crucial to recognize that fast food often contains an abundance of food preservatives and harmful substances. Overindulging in fast food is strongly associated with various health issues, such as stomach cancer and heart diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to reconsider our eating habits, with an emphasis on incorporating wholesome foods like vegetables and fruits, which are rich in essential nutrients and vitamins. These natural foods not only enhance our overall health but also sustain our energy levels, enabling us to study and work efficiently throughout the day.\nPhysical activities constitute another critical factor, regardless of one's age. In today's world, many people spend extended hours sitting in front of computers, neglecting physical exercise. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to obesity and other health problems, particularly in older age. To optimize the benefits of a clean diet, it is highly advisable to complement it with an appropriate exercise routine. I recommend that individuals dedicate time to engage in simple exercises or visit the gym at least once or twice a week. Regular exercise contributes to a healthier physique, and it's evident that individuals who embrace an active lifestyle tend to enjoy good health and well-toned bodies. Additionally, the importance of a proper rest regimen should not be overlooked. Whether it's a short afternoon nap or personal downtime on the weekend, these moments of rest are remarkably effective in rejuvenating one's energy levels and promoting overall mental well-being.\nIn conclusion, a harmonious blend of a balanced diet, regular exercise, and a well-structured rest routine is undeniably pivotal in achieving a healthier life.

    "paragraph": "In today's modern society, numerous chatting applications have emerged, and social media has profoundly altered human communication. In this essay, I will express my opinion about the primary cause of this change and demonstrate that it represents a negative development in people's lives.\nTo commence, one of the primary reasons for the shift from face-to-face communication to online chatting via social media is its sheer convenience. Firstly, social media facilitates quick communication through the use of computers or mobile phones. In the past, people relied on traditional mail services, which were inconvenient and time-consuming compared to sending emails or using online chatting applications. For instance, sending an email via Gmail, Outlook, or Messenger takes only a few seconds, making it much faster than traditional mail. Secondly, with smartphones, people can engage in conversations anytime and anywhere through various social media applications, which is impractical with face-to-face communication or traditional mail. For instance, Messenger has become a widely recognized and popular platform for online chatting.\nFrom my perspective, social media has some detrimental effects on human communication, primarily due to its impact on conversational skills and the growing disconnect between people. Individuals, especially teenagers, tend to engage in extensive social media chats, favoring short messages or acronyms, which are ill-suited for face-to-face conversations. Consequently, they gradually abandon full sentences in real-life interactions. Moreover, excessive use of chatting applications can lead to dependency on computers and mobile phones, which can negatively affect human health and pose various challenges to mental well-being. For example, individuals may develop short-sightedness or become addicted to social media if they excessively engage in online chatting.\nIn conclusion, social media has revolutionized the way people communicate, primarily due to its convenience. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that social media represents a negative development because of its adverse impacts on human communication."

    "question": "To what extent should schools prioritize academic subjects over practical skills? Discuss both perspectives and provide your own viewpoint.",
    "paragraph": "Many people argue that schools should primarily concentrate on teaching academic subjects and preparing students for examinations, while soft skills like cooking, dressmaking, and woodwork should be acquired from family and friends. I completely agree with the idea that schools should prioritize academic subjects, leaving the acquisition of practical skills to the family and friends.\nThere are several compelling reasons why schools should emphasize academic subjects. Firstly, examination results play a pivotal role in a student's academic record. Good results significantly enhance a student's chances of gaining admission to prestigious institutions, which offer an ideal environment for their personal development. For instance, students who consistently achieve top grades in high school often secure direct admission to renowned universities such as NEU, a top-tier institution known for its excellence in finance education. Secondly, academic subjects provide students with essential knowledge that forms the foundation for their tertiary education. To illustrate, in Vietnam, undergraduate students are required to pass advanced mathematics, which builds upon the mathematical concepts taught in high school. Without a strong grasp of these fundamentals, students may struggle with their university exams, leading to the need for retakes, which can be both time-consuming and costly.\nConversely, practical skills, such as cooking and laundry, are better suited to being taught by family and friends. These skills are crucial for a student's overall development, particularly for those who live far away from their families. Learning to prepare meals, for instance, enables students to become self-sufficient and avoid relying on takeout food from restaurants.\nIn conclusion, it is essential for students to strike a balance between academic subjects and practical skills. However, the responsibility of schools should primarily revolve around imparting fundamental knowledge, while parents and friends should take on the role of teaching practical life skills. This approach ensures that students receive a well-rounded education, equipping them for both academic success and the challenges of everyday life."

    "question": "To what extent do zoos serve as a valuable resource for wildlife conservation and public education, while addressing ethical concerns about animal welfare?",
    "paragraph": "Animals play a vital role in our society due to their various functions and purposes. The question of whether it is right to confine animals in zoos or if zoos serve as a source of entertainment and ecological importance is a topic of debate. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and offer my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are compelling arguments in favor of keeping wild animals in zoos. Firstly, zoos can provide protection and care for animals during adverse weather conditions such as floods, tropical storms, or even pandemics. Additionally, zoos ensure a stable food supply and professional care, often resulting in better living conditions compared to the challenges animals face in the wild. Furthermore, zoos play a critical role in conserving endangered species and preserving their genetic diversity, which can be invaluable for scientific research. For instance, certain zoos in Vietnam have successfully conserved endangered turtle species and safeguarded their genetic resources.\nHowever, there are valid concerns about the ethics and drawbacks of confining animals in zoos. Keeping animals in small enclosures, such as breeding facilities, can severely limit their freedom to roam and exhibit natural behaviors, potentially leading to bone diseases and mental health issues. Confinement in cramped spaces can induce depression among animals, which is detrimental to their overall well-being. Moreover, animals in zoos lose their ability to interact with their natural habitats and communicate with their fellow species. This can result in a shorter lifespan for these animals and financial losses for the zoos due to premature deaths.\nIn my opinion, the issue of keeping animals in zoos is not black and white. While zoos can serve important purposes such as protection from adverse conditions and conservation efforts, it is crucial to address the ethical concerns surrounding animal welfare. Zoos must prioritize the well-being of animals by providing spacious and enriched environments that mimic their natural habitats. Additionally, efforts should be made to educate the public about wildlife conservation and the importance of preserving animals' natural habitats.\nIn conclusion, the debate over the confinement of animals in zoos is multifaceted. While there are clear advantages in terms of protection and conservation, there are also ethical concerns and potential drawbacks to consider. Striking a balance between the welfare of animals and the educational and scientific benefits of zoos is essential to ensure a more ethical and sustainable approach to wildlife preservation."

    "question": "To what extent do museums serve as recreational and educational resources for young people? Discuss both perspectives and provide your own viewpoint.",
    "paragraph": "In today's fast-paced lifestyle, there is a growing debate about the role of museums for young people. Some argue that museums should primarily serve as enjoyable places for entertainment, while others believe that museums have a more significant educational purpose. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and offer my own viewpoint.\nFirst and foremost, it is clear that museums can provide a much-needed break for young individuals. For instance, many young people today enjoy visiting museums and art galleries to capture photos with the exhibits. This allows them to escape the hustle and bustle of city life effectively. Moreover, the tranquil atmosphere of museums enables young individuals to engage in recreational activities such as exploring AI programs or experiencing virtual reality related to history. Therefore, museums not only offer relief from daily pressures but also have entertainment value that can captivate the youth.\nOn the other hand, an increasing number of people believe that museums play a crucial role in educating the younger generation. By offering a wide range of information, such as local history, science, and technology, museums can help young individuals expand their knowledge, which can be beneficial for their personal lives and academic pursuits. Furthermore, visiting museums allows young people to enhance their cognitive abilities. For instance, each exhibition conveys meaningful messages from its creators to the audience, thereby enabling individuals to improve their knowledge and awareness. Therefore, museums are a vital resource for the education of young people.\nIn conclusion, young people are drawn to museums because they offer both entertainment and educational opportunities. However, based on the preceding discussion, I wholeheartedly agree that museums play an essential role in educating young individuals and are fundamental cornerstones for nurturing their knowledge."

    "paragraph": "In today's world, many individuals find themselves needing to relocate in pursuit of employment opportunities, primarily due to fierce competition in the job market. This essay aims to examine both the advantages and disadvantages of this trend, ultimately concluding that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that starting a new life far from one's home can offer certain advantages. Firstly, individuals may have a greater chance of securing well-paying job opportunities, especially in economically developed countries like Japan or the USA. This can lead to increased job satisfaction and faster career advancement, which are desirable for many employees. Additionally, moving away from friends and family can expand one's social network significantly. Exposure to a new community enables people to meet new individuals, make fresh acquaintances, and form genuine friendships.\nHowever, despite these advantages, I am convinced that the disadvantages of this trend are more prominent for various compelling reasons. Firstly, the financial burden that relocating individuals must bear is a significant concern. To elaborate, the initial salary in a new job may not cover essential expenses like housing and transportation, leading to financial stress and hardship. Another important consideration is the overwhelming feeling of homesickness and isolation experienced by those who distance themselves from loved ones. This is a result of reduced face-to-face interactions and diminished quality time spent with family and friends.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that relocating for work can bring about several benefits, I believe that the drawbacks outweigh the advantages."

    "question": "To what extent is advertising responsible for driving product sales, compared to consumer demand?",
    "paragraph": "In today's modern society, thanks to the ever-expanding presence of technology, shopping has become incredibly convenient. While some argue that advertising plays a pivotal role in driving product sales, others believe that high sales figures are primarily driven by consumer demand. In this essay, I will explore the rationale behind both perspectives.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that a significant number of consumers are influenced to make purchases through digital marketing. To illustrate, advertisements often present captivating visuals and engaging audio effects that pique viewers' curiosity. Consequently, after being immersed in catchy tunes and vibrant images, customers are inclined to buy products, irrespective of their actual needs. A prime example of this is celebrity endorsements; when popular figures endorse a particular product, its sales revenue can soar significantly.\nFurthermore, the exaggeration in promoting newly-launched products is another factor to consider. Specifically, businesses tend to overstate the quality of their products in the hopes of grabbing customers' attention and boosting sales. Consequently, false advertising can lead consumers to invest substantial sums of money in low-quality products that do not meet their actual needs.\nOn the other hand, sales figures rise in accordance with customer demand. Depending on the season and specific times, customers have varying requirements for different types of products. For instance, during the winter season, sales of warm coats increase, while sunscreen sales surge during the summer. Therefore, it is evident that the sales of each product are reflective of the customers' specific needs at any given time."

    "paragraph": "It is indisputable that sharing information plays a pivotal role in advancing technology, research, and various industries. Some individuals argue that certain information holds immense significance and freely sharing it may lead to loss of benefits and disputes over ownership. Personally, I strongly advocate for the dissemination of knowledge rather than hoarding it. In the ensuing paragraphs, I will explore both perspectives and articulate my own stance.\nOn one hand, when we exchange information, we can expedite progress in scientific research and education. It possesses the potential to benefit people from all walks of life, whether they are affluent or economically disadvantaged, by broadening their knowledge horizons. The fundamental rationale behind this viewpoint is that when a larger number of individuals have access to information, it can lead to constant feedback, thereby enhancing research and commercial solutions. We all face limitations in terms of resources and capacity for meaningful research, but these constraints are mitigated when information exchange is open and inclusive.\nOn the other hand, some organizations opt to safeguard specific details because they perceive it as necessary. They believe that they should reap the rewards of their investments in research within a particular domain. To maintain a competitive edge and prevent potential patent disputes, companies also keep sensitive information concerning their financial status and algorithms confidential. Sharing such critical knowledge might entail substantial financial costs and erode their competitive advantage.\nIn conclusion, the act of sharing knowledge empowers us to develop mature and sustainable solutions. Concerns regarding the drawbacks of sharing knowledge are, in my opinion, unfounded."

Views on this matter are divided, with some condemning the confinement of animals, while others endorse zoos for their role in providing entertainment to the public and raising awareness about ecological issues. This essay will explore both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint.\nMany supporters of zoos argue that they serve a vital purpose in both entertaining the public and contributing to ecological conservation. Zoos offer a unique opportunity for people to observe and learn about animals they might never encounter in their natural habitat. Additionally, zoos often engage in various conservation programs aimed at safeguarding endangered species from extinction. For instance, they provide secure environments for animals whose natural habitats are under threat, allowing them to potentially restore wild populations in the future.\nConversely, critics of zoos argue that confining animals in captivity violates their fundamental rights. In their natural habitats, animals have the freedom to roam, hunt, socialize, and engage in their natural behaviors. When placed in small enclosures within zoos, these animals often lose these essential aspects of their lives. Many animals experience stress and frustration due to the limited space, leading to repetitive behaviors and self-inflicted harm.\nIn conclusion, the ongoing debate regarding the ethics of zoos and their ecological importance presents valid arguments on both sides. However, in my opinion, the focus should be on establishing ethical zoos that prioritize the rights and well-being of animals, emphasizing the value of all living beings."

    "paragraph": "With significant technological advancements that have significantly extended human life expectancy, the continuously rising global population remains a major concern in our contemporary society. This phenomenon has led to adverse outcomes, which I will discuss in this essay.\nThere are several compelling factors contributing to the ongoing increase in the world's population. Firstly, societies now have unprecedented access to improved healthcare facilities and resources. Governments are increasingly prioritizing the health and safety of their citizens, leading to the expansion of health centers and advancements in healthcare services. For instance, diseases once considered incurable can now be eradicated with the assistance of skilled healthcare professionals and innovative treatment methods. Secondly, the world is experiencing a period of relative peace. In the past, a significant number of lives were lost in frequent large-scale conflicts. However, in the present era, many nations have adopted policies of peace, fostering connections and diplomatic compromises to minimize the risk of war. A prime example is the establishment of the United Nations Organization, dedicated to maintaining international peace and security and preventing acts of aggression among nations.\nOverpopulation unquestionably stands as humanity's greatest challenge. This trend has given rise to alarming environmental degradation. As more people consume resources, they generate waste and pollution that harm the environment. This can lead to issues such as soil erosion, water pollution, and other forms of environmental damage with severe consequences. Furthermore, overpopulation can result in overcrowding and resource scarcity, making it difficult for individuals to secure adequate housing. This predicament is especially pronounced in developing countries with limited infrastructure and resources.\nIn conclusion, the recent increase in the global population can be attributed to technological advancements.

    "paragraph": "In today's world, thanks to technological innovations, there is a significant shift in how people work. Some individuals believe that technology has a negative impact on employees. However, this essay will discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of these changes.\nTo begin with, technology is reducing the personal time of many workers. With the availability of tools that enable employees to work remotely, people are constantly under pressure from their jobs. Workers are often expected to complete tasks even when they are on vacation or during the weekend. For instance, employees, especially in the service and customer care industries, often spend a significant portion of their personal time addressing customer requirements as part of their responsibilities. This trend is becoming increasingly common in various professions, thanks to technological support.\nOn the positive side, by making full use of technological tools, workers can improve their job efficiency and save a lot of time through remote work. Thanks to advancements in internet technology and useful applications from various tech companies, employees can complete their tasks without the need to be physically present in the office. This not only reduces the fatigue associated with long commutes but also saves time otherwise spent in traffic. For example, many private enterprises and startups now have policies that allow employees to work remotely as long as they meet their job requirements. Furthermore, this approach helps significantly reduce operational costs, especially during economic downturns.\nIn conclusion, technological advancements have a profound impact on employees, although they also pose challenges in terms of personal time. This situation is likely to bring about significant changes in the way people work."

Some argue that it is the government's duty to address this issue, while others believe that parents should share this responsibility. In my view, both the government and parents should play a role in tackling this problem.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some people advocate for government intervention. Firstly, governments often have the necessary resources and funding to launch large-scale public health campaigns. For instance, they can invest in educational programs designed to raise children's awareness of the serious consequences of unhealthy eating habits. They can also extend school hours to promote physical activity among students. Such initiatives can actively encourage a healthier lifestyle for children and, consequently, contribute to a reduction in obesity rates.\nHowever, I firmly believe that parents should also take on this responsibility. One compelling reason is that parents serve as the primary influencers and role models for their children. Therefore, they have the most direct impact on their child?? lifestyle choices, including diet and physical activity. For example, parents can impart crucial lessons to their children about making healthy food choices with less sugar and fat. Simultaneously, they can encourage their children to engage in more physical activity or exercise.\nIn conclusion, there are valid reasons to support the idea that the government should take responsibility for addressing the growing issue of childhood obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that parents should also shoulder this responsibility. By working together, both the government and parents can make significant strides in improving the health and well-being of our children."

    "paragraph": "In today's world, we have witnessed a significant transformation in the structure of families and the roles of family members. While this shift is not without its drawbacks, I am of the opinion that its benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn one hand, there are numerous advantages to altering the family structure that are quite noteworthy. Firstly, there is a shift from extended families, where three or more generations cohabitate under one roof, to nuclear families, where a married couple lives with their children. This change is particularly welcome as it helps prevent conflicts, misunderstandings, and inconveniences. Different people have varying lifestyles, personalities, and schedules, which can lead to issues in extended families. For example, sharing bathrooms can be a hassle in such situations, whereas every family member can comfortably use the household facilities in a nuclear family. Consequently, the transformation in family structure has significantly improved the quality of life and society as a whole.\nOn the other hand, it would be unwise to underestimate the advantages of the evolving roles of family members. Most notably, there has been a significant increase in the financial contributions of women. In the past, men typically served as the primary breadwinners, while women were responsible for child-rearing, cooking, and household chores. However, as family members' roles have evolved, both partners have started participating in the workforce to enhance their financial stability. In some cases, husbands have chosen to step back and become stay-at-home fathers. As a result, these changes have contributed to greater gender equality and improved access to various rights in areas such as education and employment.\nIn conclusion, the current era has witnessed substantial changes in family structure and the roles of family members. While this trend is not without its disadvantages, I firmly believe that its advantages are more pronounced. Therefore, it is crucial for households to carefully assess both the benefits and drawbacks of these changes before reaching an optimal solution."

    "paragraph": "In numerous countries, the percentage of older individuals is gradually on the rise. I firmly believe that this trend can potentially have more adverse effects on society, primarily due to a decrease in the available workforce and an increase in welfare expenses.\nOne significant issue that can stem from a higher proportion of elderly citizens in a nation is the scarcity of laborers. This occurs because older individuals are prone to health problems that can hinder their effectiveness in the workplace. For instance, elderly individuals with conditions like Alzheimer's may experience memory loss, leading to reduced job performance and productivity, ultimately affecting business revenues. In contrast, younger workers generally enjoy better health and adapt more swiftly to new technologies, making them better suited to meet the current demands of the job market. Consequently, a surge in the elderly population in some countries may result in a labor shortage.\nThe second challenge arising from the increasing number of elderly individuals is the mounting cost of social welfare. Due to the heightened demand for welfare, especially healthcare services, governments may need to invest more in constructing essential infrastructure such as hospitals or retirement homes. Furthermore, public authorities or private organizations may find themselves incurring substantial expenses to support retirement pensions. As people live longer, the number of retirees drawing pensions increases, placing heavier financial burdens on governments and organizations.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the steady increase in the elderly population can have more negative repercussions on society, including a reduced workforce and higher social welfare costs."

The focal point of recent debates revolves around whether we should dismantle these remnants of the past to make way for contemporary architecture. While some may express skepticism about retaining these structures for safety reasons, I firmly believe that we should celebrate their virtues as a reminder of our historical and cultural heritage, preventing them from fading into obscurity.\nOne compelling argument in favor of preserving these ancient treasures revolves around the traditional and cultural values embedded in their architectural styles. Throughout history, each era has imposed its unique standards for designing magnificent structures and living spaces, dictating the criteria for selecting building materials and incorporating decorative motifs and structural frameworks. Some of these designs still captivate us today with their exquisite beauty. Safeguarding these remnants of bygone eras allows us to appreciate the evolution of our society and its diverse cultural values. For instance, the Thang Long Imperial Citadel in Vietnam stands as a globally renowned historical site, showcasing its distinctive architecture, including a rectangular-shaped fortress, intricately carved stone palaces, and a 5-meter high brick and stone wall designed for military strategic purposes. Such structures serve as a testament to the country's rich history spanning various epochs.\nIt is true that some architects harbor reservations about maintaining these ancient edifices, given that many of them date back several decades or even centuries, and a significant portion may have suffered from considerable wear and tear, with a heightened risk of structural damage or collapse. However, this concern can be mitigated through diligent maintenance and renovation efforts overseen by responsible management teams. Consequently, the potential hazards associated with these buildings can be minimized. Moreover, such restoration projects offer a valuable opportunity to engage the younger generation in preserving their cultural heritage and bridging generational gaps.\nIn conclusion, while some architects may raise concerns about the safety of historic buildings, I believe that these concerns are unwarranted when we consider the potential benefits of restoration work.

    "paragraph": "It is widely believed that as large organizations continue to grow, there is a prevailing disparity in the salaries between the top-level executives and the regular employees. Some argue that this situation is necessary, while others view it as unjust. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and provide my own opinion.\nOn one hand, it is argued that there are valid reasons for leaders of conglomerates to earn significantly higher salaries than ordinary staff members. One such reason is that when directors shoulder an equivalent workload as regular employees, they should be duly rewarded for their contributions. Equity in the workplace demands that those who bear similar responsibilities receive commensurate compensation. An illustrative example of this is when a director's responsibilities might appear minimal, yet their leadership role is crucial. In such cases, directors often receive higher incomes than employees who are engaged in more extensive tasks. Another factor contributing to this wage disparity is that directors primarily oversee and delegate tasks to their subordinates, without necessarily engaging in the hands-on work. This power dynamic can create a fear among workers, who may face penalties or termination if they fail to comply with their director's instructions. For instance, if an employee fails to complete a task assigned by their director, the director, given their influence within the company, can exert pressure or even initiate their dismissal.\nDespite these apparent inequities in the workplace, I firmly believe that the higher salaries of top-ranking employees are justified. This is primarily due to the immense effort that managers invest in building and sustaining large conglomerates. Many directors have ascended to their positions after years of diligent work as ordinary employees, proving their dedication and perseverance. For instance, directors often have long-standing affiliations with their organizations and contribute significantly to their financial success. Therefore, rewarding them with substantial salaries is a fair acknowledgment of their contributions. Additionally, the experience and decisiveness of managers play a pivotal role in their success. In critical moments that could impact the survival of the conglomerate, leaders must rely on their skills and talents to make informed decisions. When these decisions lead to success, it is only fitting that they receive rewards commensurate with their qualifications.\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that the wage gap between managers of large organizations and regular employees is unfair, I contend that it is justified when directors exhibit strong leadership skills and contribute significantly to the company's success. Salary discrepancies should reflect the effort and experience of individuals in their respective roles."

While I acknowledge the drawbacks associated with this phenomenon, I firmly believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nIt is evident that consumer goods can disrupt the balance between work and personal life. The proliferation of various types of products often compels individuals to work longer hours in pursuit of a better standard of living. Consequently, this increased work commitment can lead to the neglect of self-care and leisure activities, ultimately resulting in mental health issues, such as depression and insomnia.

Firstly, the substantial expenses associated with automated systems can strain government finances, potentially leading to budget deficits, increased taxes, or reduced social welfare programs. Consequently, ordinary citizens, particularly those with lower incomes, may find it even more challenging to make ends meet. Secondly, excessive reliance on automated machinery and processes can be problematic. For instance, in Japan, many companies employ robotic engineering and technologies for manufacturing instead of human workers, resulting in a rise in unemployment and financial difficulties for individuals who lose their jobs. This, in turn, affects their ability to afford basic necessities like housing, food, and healthcare.\nOn the other hand, there are compelling reasons to believe that technological advancements offer numerous benefits to people. The primary advantage lies in the role of robotics in our communities. This enables individuals to manage a wide range of tasks more efficiently, allowing them to allocate more time for personal activities such as shopping with friends, preparing meals, and spending quality time with their families. Additionally, automation greatly improves the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. For example, many visually impaired individuals invest in robot cleaners and helpers to assist with household chores, while autonomous vehicles provide them with newfound mobility, allowing them to lead more independent lives and boost their self-confidence.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that there are some disadvantages associated with the adoption of new technology, I contend that technological innovations can significantly enhance the lives of people in various ways."

    "question": "To what extent should governments allocate more financial resources to help illiterate adults acquire reading and writing skills?",
    "paragraph": "Governments worldwide rightfully prioritize the education of younger generations. However, the alarmingly high number of illiterate adults, even in some of the most advanced nations like the US, has ignited public debate regarding whether more financial resources should be allocated to help these individuals acquire reading and writing skills. I firmly support the idea that this is a worthwhile endeavor, benefiting not only the individuals themselves but also the nation as a whole.\nTo begin with, adults who lack basic literacy skills face significant challenges in their personal and professional lives. Literacy programs equip them with the essential knowledge and skills needed to overcome these hurdles. For instance, participants in these courses will no longer feel powerless when they want to read a bedtime story to their children or compose an email to their friends. Similarly, they will no longer be denied opportunities for career advancement solely due to their literacy shortcomings. Therefore, adult education liberates individuals with limited literacy levels, empowering them to succeed in both personal and professional spheres.\nFurthermore, countries that choose to invest more in adult education can also reap economic benefits. A better-educated workforce can serve as a catalyst for economic growth, as observed in countries like Vietnam, where a clear connection exists between the eradication of illiteracy and economic development. Additionally, literate parents tend to be more effective in raising their children, and thus, investing in adult education leads to better-raised children. The ripple effect of this investment includes a sustainable economy and an improved society.\nIn conclusion, providing access to education for illiterate adults is a sensible and economically sound initiative that should be embraced on a broader scale."
