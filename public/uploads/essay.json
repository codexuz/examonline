    "question": "Should professionals be required to work in their home country after completing their training?",
    "paragraph": "While many people hold the belief that professionals, including doctors and engineers, bear a responsibility to their home country where they received their training, I hold the view that they should have the freedom to work in any country they prefer due to the potential for higher earnings.\nOn one hand, it is argued that professionals often receive significant financial support from their government to complete their training. It is only reasonable that they reciprocate this support by contributing their skills to the same country. This is especially justified because their work often brings substantial benefits to society, which is why the government invested in their education in the first place. For instance, in the UK, substantial funds are allocated to train junior doctors, covering university tuition fees and on-the-job training.\nHowever, every individual should be afforded the opportunity to reach their full potential. Professionals, by virtue of their qualifications, represent some of the most highly skilled individuals globally. Consequently, there is a high demand for their expertise worldwide, allowing them to command significantly higher salaries when working abroad. Restricting their ability to do so would result in a considerable financial disadvantage for the individual. Take, for example, petroleum engineers who can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars more in oil-rich countries like Saudi Arabia compared to staying in Europe. In my opinion, the individual's right to choose where they work should take precedence over any nationalist sentiments.\nIn conclusion, despite the substantial investment in a professional's education and training, they should have the autonomy to decide whether to give back to their home country through their work or seek opportunities in regions that offer higher compensation for their skills."

    "question": "Should we prioritize researching our family history or focusing on the present and future generations?",
    "paragraph": "Some people argue that we should research our family history, while others believe we should focus on the present and future generations. This essay will discuss both viewpoints and present my own opinion.\nOn one hand, there are significant benefits to understanding our family's past. One of the most important advantages is the ability to identify genetic diseases like asthma and Down syndrome. Detecting these inherited health issues early allows for timely treatment, potentially saving lives and improving overall quality of life. Additionally, delving into family history can strengthen the bonds among family members. Research often uncovers not only the origins of the family but also the stories of sacrifice and determination that our ancestors displayed in overcoming challenges. These stories can instill a deep sense of pride and belonging in future generations.\nHowever, there are valid reasons to prioritize the present and future generations. The most compelling reason is the need to address urgent contemporary issues such as housing, employment, and nutrition. Tackling these pressing problems can significantly enhance people's living standards, leading to a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction. Furthermore, the financial and time resources used for historical research could be better invested in the development of children. Properly nurtured children have the potential to become capable and responsible individuals who not only create prosperity for themselves but also support their family members. Neglecting their development in favor of past research might hinder their growth.\nIn conclusion, both perspectives have their merits. However, I believe that prioritizing the present and future generations is essential due to the urgency of addressing current pressing problems and the significance of nurturing children. Therefore, it is crucial for adult family members to collaborate and create a comprehensive plan for the effective allocation of resources to meet these immediate and important needs."

    "question": "To what extent does leadership depend on innate qualities versus learned skills?",
    "paragraph": "There is a prevailing belief that some individuals possess innate leadership abilities, while others contend that leadership skills can be acquired through learning. While it is true that some exceptional leaders have natural talents, I concur that the process of training plays a significant role in shaping great leaders.\nTo begin with, many people are born with certain leadership qualities, such as courage, as an inherent part of their personality. It is important to note that effective leaders must develop the ability to make decisions confidently, which typically evolves over time. They need to demonstrate persistence and not shy away from making choices. Additionally, they must take responsibility for their failures and setbacks. These traits gradually develop as they navigate through life. Therefore, it is essential for leaders to be resolute in defining their goals.\nOn the contrary, proponents of the idea that leadership skills can be learned argue that training programs provide individuals with opportunities to enhance their leadership attributes. For instance, in a professional setting, discipline plays a crucial role in a leader's personal qualities. Such discipline is often instilled through classroom-based training, where participants are required to strictly adhere to schedules and complete challenging tasks. Moreover, various lessons and activities provide them with the chance to hone their problem-solving skills. Regular classroom training, for instance, equips people with the confidence to address unexpected challenges, thanks to the valuable guidance offered by experienced instructors who specialize in specific areas.\nIn conclusion, I believe that there are valid arguments on both sides of this debate. Exceptional leaders with innate qualities, including courage, can indeed make significant contributions to their personal development, which is closely tied to their success as leaders. Simultaneously, there are essential leadership attributes that can be acquired through practical training courses."

    "question": "What are the causes of the increasing demand for food worldwide, and how can the international community address this challenge?",
    "paragraph": "The global population is swiftly increasing, and consequently, the demand for food is on the rise as well. This essay will explore the reasons behind the escalating demand for food and the steps that the international community can take to address this issue.\nOne of the primary reasons for the heightened demand for food worldwide is the steadily growing global population. As the population continues to expand, so does the need for food. A notable illustration of the connection between population growth and food demand is evident in China's case. Over the past few decades, China's population has grown significantly, leading to a corresponding increase in the demand for food. Additionally, alterations in dietary preferences and an uptick in urbanization have also played a role in the surge in food demand. As people migrate to urban areas, they often adopt more processed, high-calorie diets, which further fuel the demand for food.\nTo address this situation, the international community can implement several measures. Firstly, promoting sustainable agricultural practices can boost food production while minimizing the environmental impact of farming. For example, sustainable farming techniques like conservation tillage, crop diversification, and agroforestry have proven effective in enhancing soil health, reducing erosion, and increasing water efficiency. These practices lead to more sustainable and productive farming systems. Secondly, investing in research and development to enhance crop yields, develop drought-resistant crops, and refine farming methods can enhance agricultural productivity. Through more efficient irrigation systems, improved fertilizers, and better pest control methods, we can assist farmers in producing more food with less land, water, and other resources. This, in turn, contributes to meeting the surging global demand for food.\nIn conclusion, the mounting demand for food worldwide stems from various complex factors. To address this challenge, the international community can adopt measures such as promoting sustainable agriculture, investing in research and development, and minimizing food wastage."

    "question": "What are the three primary types of relationships that shape human lives, and how do they contribute to personal growth and development?",
    "paragraph": "Nearly all individuals on Earth live within a community, engaging in a variety of human relationships. Among these, family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships hold particular importance.\nFirstly, family relationships are established from birth. Families come in various sizes, including immediate families, which consist of parents and their children, and extended families, where multiple generations reside together under one roof. These relationships are formed not only through blood ties but also through legal bonds, such as adoption. Regardless of the type of family one belongs to or how they became part of it, family relationships play a crucial role in upbringing, shaping people's attitudes, and influencing their behavior in later life.\nSocial development is closely linked to personal growth. After family relationships, individuals enter into friendships, often with those of a similar age and shared hobbies during childhood, and common interests and life goals as adults. Friendships are built on shared experiences, and friends are often the ones to whom people confide their secrets when they find it challenging to do so with family members, particularly during adolescence when teenagers spend a significant amount of time at school with their peers. However, it's important to note that not all friends can be trusted equally; true, lasting friendships are developed over time.\nLastly, romantic relationships also play a significant role in most people's lives. People have deep emotional connections with their romantic partners, and these relationships typically progress through phases of love, where passion is strong initially but may diminish over time. In contrast, feelings of trust, emotional intimacy, and commitment tend to grow stronger as the relationship matures beyond the stages of dating and marriage. A key lesson in romantic relationships is learning to respect differences to nurture a lifelong, fulfilling partnership.\nIn conclusion, three primary types of relationships shape human lives: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. Each of these connections offers valuable opportunities for personal growth and development, enabling individuals to become the best versions of themselves and cultivate meaningful, quality relationships with others."

    "paragraph": "Most individuals around the world lead communal lives, engaged in various and intricate human relationships. Among these, three fundamental types of relationships stand out: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships.\nTo begin with, family relationships are established from birth. People belong to diverse family structures, such as immediate families comprising parents and their children, or extended families where multiple generations reside together. Beyond blood connections, family ties can also be formed through legal bonds, such as adoption. Regardless of the type of family one is a part of or how they became members, family relationships play a pivotal role in upbringing, shaping individuals' attitudes and behaviors as they progress in life.\nAs people grow and develop, their social lives evolve accordingly. Following family relationships, individuals enter into friendships, often with peers of similar age and shared interests, especially during childhood. Over time, friends accumulate shared experiences, and it is not uncommon for people to confide in their closest friends about matters they find challenging to discuss with family members, particularly teenagers who spend a significant amount of time at school with their friends. However, it is important to note that not every acquaintance can be trusted; true, enduring friendships, often referred to as \"best friends,\" are built over time.\nLastly, romantic relationships occupy a significant portion of human lives. People experience unique emotions in their romantic partnerships, which vary based on their love phase. In general, the intensity of passionate feelings tends to diminish as relationships progress, while sentiments of trust, emotional intimacy, and commitment tend to grow stronger beyond the initial stages of knowing each other, dating, and getting married. In romantic relationships, a valuable lesson is to embrace and respect differences in order to maintain a lifelong, fulfilling partnership.\nIn conclusion, there are three primary categories of human relationships that significantly impact one's life: family relationships, friendships, and romantic relationships. Each of these relationships offers opportunities for personal growth and development, helping individuals become the best versions of themselves and fostering high-quality connections with others."

    "paragraph": "There is a debate regarding whether individuals should delve into their family history to learn more about the past, or whether their focus should be on the present and future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and provide reasons for my belief that concentrating on the present and the future is essential for sustainable development.\nSupporters of exploring family history put forward two valid arguments. The primary one is that information about the past carries significant cultural value regarding the traditions and heritage of one's lineage. This knowledge can create an intangible connection to one's ancestors, instilling a sense of belonging and pride. Moreover, people can learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them. By drawing lessons from their forebears, they can pass on life experiences and wisdom to younger generations, enabling them to make informed decisions when they encounter similar situations.\nHowever, an alternative perspective argues that it is more crucial to be oriented towards the present and the future. The driving force behind this argument is that people can address pressing issues and make necessary adjustments in the ever-evolving world. Modern challenges such as climate change, poverty, and other social problems require immediate action and innovative thinking. Furthermore, many family traditions and beliefs have become outdated and unsuitable for today's society. Therefore, to ensure that social progress is not hindered by obsolete customs and ideologies, people should direct their attention towards the present and future generations. This way, younger individuals can develop their own sets of values and eliminate inappropriate practices.\nIn conclusion, while discovering ancestral backgrounds can help preserve important family cultures and offer invaluable life lessons, I believe that emphasizing the present and future generations is more effective in addressing ongoing challenges and promoting sustainable personal growth. Therefore, I am convinced that contemporary and future age groups should receive more attention from the general public."

    "paragraph": "Many individuals often prioritize salary when selecting a job. In my view, I strongly disagree with this perspective.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge the importance of money in meeting one's basic needs such as housing, food, healthcare, and education. People generally consider earning a sufficient income as a primary means to afford these necessities and maintain a reasonable quality of life. For instance, individuals who pursue careers driven by their passions, like artists and musicians, often struggle financially. While they follow their love, their chosen professions may not provide them with enough income to live comfortably or support a family.\nOn the other hand, I believe that certain factors outweigh monetary considerations when making job choices. Firstly, the quality of personal relationships and the work environment play a pivotal role in job satisfaction. Having supportive managers and congenial colleagues can significantly contribute to one's career growth and overall happiness at work. Secondly, aligning one's career with their educational background and field of study is crucial. When a job aligns with one's major, they are more likely to excel and perform exceptionally in that role. Lastly, many individuals select their professions with the intention of making a positive impact on society and helping others.\nIn conclusion, while salary is undeniably important for meeting basic needs, a strong attachment to one's work and job satisfaction are equally crucial for a fulfilling life. I firmly believe that considerations beyond monetary compensation should take precedence when choosing a career path."

    "question": "Should medical services be controlled by the government or by private companies?",
    "paragraph": "In today's world, there is an ongoing debate regarding the control of medical services, with some advocating for government oversight and others favoring private companies. While some argue that governments should primarily manage medical services, I firmly believe that entrusting this responsibility to private firms offers more advantages.\nOn one hand, government involvement seems reasonable to some extent. This is primarily due to the financial resources available to the state and its ability to mobilize resources, making it crucial in ensuring medical services' availability to the general population. By allocating state funds to establish public hospitals and healthcare centers in underserved areas, governments can guarantee that even the most vulnerable individuals have access to essential medical treatments. In contrast, private companies often prioritize profit generation, which may lead to higher costs and limited accessibility.\nOn the other hand, while government participation in public welfare is undoubtedly essential, I recognize that allowing private companies to manage medical services can provide greater benefits for several compelling reasons. Firstly, the substantial cost of providing healthcare to the community could strain government finances, potentially resulting in budget deficits, tax increases, or reduced social welfare. Consequently, ordinary citizens, especially the underprivileged, may face even greater financial challenges. Furthermore, it is vital to acknowledge that private companies can make significant contributions to the healthcare sector by introducing competition and innovation. This can be further reinforced by the coexistence of private healthcare providers alongside government facilities, fostering a healthy competitive environment that encourages all parties to strive for excellence and improve the quality of care.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of the government taking charge of medical services may appeal to some, I argue that private enterprises should be entrusted with this responsibility."

    "paragraph": "In recent decades, it is evident that private healthcare has become increasingly vital in our society. However, some individuals argue that good health and well-being are essential for everyone, and thus healthcare services should not be overseen by privately-owned profit-driven companies. While this trend has brought certain advantages, I believe that the disadvantages outweigh them.\nOn one hand, private healthcare facilities like hospitals and clinics can alleviate the burden on public medical centers. For instance, during outbreaks such as COVID-19 or the SARS outbreak in 2003, when the number of hospitalized patients surged daily, employing private healthcare services could assist state-owned hospital staff in providing better care for their patients and alleviate the strain on the public healthcare system.\nOn the other hand, I contend that these drawbacks are more significant than the benefits. Firstly, if private companies manage medical services, private health insurance becomes imperative to avoid the high costs. Moreover, this may lead to increased competition among health insurance providers, resulting in higher premiums. Lastly, governments can ensure equitable access to hospitals, while private companies tend to concentrate their hospitals mainly in metropolitan areas because it is challenging to generate profits in smaller, less populated towns.\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that the drawbacks of entrusting medical services to profit-driven companies outweigh the benefits they bring to citizens. Private health insurance should remain an option rather than a mandatory prerequisite for accessing medical services."

    "paragraph": "In recent years, significant cultural transformations have occurred worldwide due to the exchange of cultures, bringing various parts of the world closer together. Some argue that the annual disappearance of numerous languages is not a significant issue because it will not hinder communication. From my perspective, I agree with this view that the disappearance of less widely spoken languages is not a crucial problem.\nFirst and foremost, language primarily serves as a means of communication, and the number of speakers plays a pivotal role in this context. English, for example, has become an international language with a large number of speakers, especially after the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, individuals seeking international employment opportunities must possess proficiency in English to enhance their knowledge, career prospects, and financial situations. Therefore, if the global population adopts a common language, many individuals can reduce the educational demands placed upon them. For instance, people can allocate the time they would have spent on language studies to other educational pursuits, and parents would be relieved of the financial burden of enrolling their children in English courses.\nA second reason why I believe that the decline of less widely spoken languages, particularly those of ethnic minorities, is not a problem relates to finances. Moreover, it can enhance individuals' capacity for skill development by affording them the opportunity to access diverse global sources of knowledge. Less commonly spoken languages often hinder many individuals from acquiring valuable knowledge. Ultimately, a common language can facilitate connections among all individuals who share a common knowledge base.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the extinction of some less spoken languages would bring about significant changes, providing us with more convenience in the global village."

This has sparked an ongoing debate about who should be responsible for medical services, whether it should be the government or profit-making companies. In my view, I wholeheartedly agree with the statement, and this essay will explain the reasons supporting this stance.\nTo start, when medical systems are under government management, it ensures that everyone has an equal chance to access medical services, regardless of their financial situation. For instance, in the United States, when private companies took over medical services from the government, the prices for services such as general checkups and surgeries significantly increased.

This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this trend.\nThere are several reasons that contribute to this phenomenon, primarily driven by the advantages it offers to individuals. For instance, individuals may relocate to access a wider range of job opportunities in larger cities, providing them with significant career advantages. Some people may choose to live closer to their workplace, which can significantly reduce their commute time and increase their efficiency. Additionally, there are individuals who prefer to work independently and do not rely on their family for support.\nHowever, this trend also presents various challenges for both individuals and their families. Those who live far from their families often experience feelings of loneliness because they can only communicate with their loved ones through phone calls or messages. Prolonged periods of work-related stress can be difficult to manage without the support and comfort of family members or close friends. Being unable to share their problems with loved ones and friends can lead to emotional breakdowns.\nWhile there are undeniable advantages to this trend, such as enhanced job prospects and income potential, I believe that these advantages cannot outweigh the disadvantages.

While some argue in favor of watching TV, I firmly believe that reading is a crucial key to stimulating people's minds.\nIt is undeniable that TV shows can easily capture people's attention due to their captivating visuals, especially for the younger generation. However, they leave little room for our imagination to soar. TV shows and films often convey information through the words and actions of characters, resulting in passive consumption. Viewers simply absorb the content without actively processing or questioning it. Moreover, the fast pace of screen-based entertainment makes it challenging for viewers to fully grasp the author's deeper meaning.\nOn the contrary, reading books not only enriches the imaginative process but also fosters creativity. It can be seen as a source of entertainment because people can utilize their imagination to picture the characters and settings. For example, I once envisioned the chaotic sinking scene of the Titanic after reading the classic romance novel \"Romeo and Juliet.\" I felt like I was immersed in that atmosphere, which evoked sympathy for the two main characters. Additionally, cultivating a reading habit helps us expand our vocabulary and grasp various grammatical structures, which are vital components for improving language proficiency.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that watching TV encourages passive behavior and does not offer the same level of cognitive engagement and linguistic benefits as reading.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this idea?\nI mostly disagree with the viewpoint that children should engage in work alongside their academic studies. First and foremost, children attend school primarily to acquire knowledge, not to participate in labor. Due to their young age, children's mental and physical faculties are not yet fully developed for performing work tasks. Their primary role in school is to acquire fundamental skills in subjects such as mathematics and literacy. Additionally, schools provide a conducive environment for young learners to engage in conversations with their peers on various topics of interest and to develop essential soft skills, all without the constant supervision of their parents.\nFor example, it is crucial for children to grasp basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and division, as these are fundamental life skills. However, delving into the complexities of the world of work is not a primary objective of the educational system. Indeed, many schools worldwide do not incorporate work-related instruction into their curriculum.\nOn the other hand, the world of work is better suited for older adolescents, typically around the age of 18. When students decide to pursue tertiary education, it signifies their intent to gain in-depth knowledge in a specific field, which will serve them in their future careers. Consequently, they can simultaneously study academic subjects and engage in internships in various workplaces to gain practical experience. Conversely, for those who do not pursue further education, the age of 18 is an appropriate time to enter the workforce, as they have reached a level of intellectual and physical maturity that makes them better prepared for employment.\nIn conclusion, I oppose the notion that children should spend a brief period working while they are still in school because they lack the necessary maturity for the world of work. The teaching of work-related skills should coincide with their physical and mental development, which typically occurs around the age of 18."

    "paragraph": "There is a viewpoint that argues that medical services, being essential for human well-being, should not be driven by profit-oriented companies. While there are indeed certain drawbacks to this idea, I believe that the positive impacts outweigh the negatives.\nOn one hand, private healthcare systems do come with some disadvantages. One significant drawback is the steep cost that patients have to bear. This is primarily because private hospitals incur substantial expenses on amenities such as state-of-the-art medical equipment in the operating rooms, deluxe accommodations, and competitive salaries for medical professionals. For instance, consider a pregnant woman who opts for Vinmec, the largest private international hospital in Vietnam; she may end up paying double or even triple the amount compared to a state-run hospital. Consequently, private healthcare can be financially burdensome for individuals who cannot afford these costs, potentially creating an inequality in access to care and treatment.\nOn the other hand, an increasing number of private hospitals today offer various benefits. Firstly, they provide quicker services compared to public health facilities where long waiting lists are often the norm. As a result, both patients with life-threatening conditions and those seeking routine check-ups can receive the treatment they need in a more time-efficient manner. Furthermore, private medical centers expand the options available to individuals facing medical issues. Given the limited number of government-run hospitals and the growing demand for medical services, prompt access to treatment would be a significant challenge without the presence of these private healthcare providers.\nIn conclusion, while private medical companies do have their shortcomings, such as high costs and limited insurance coverage, I argue that they play a crucial role in delivering quality healthcare services to their targeted clientele."

In my view, the benefits of this development far outweigh the drawbacks.\nFirst and foremost, this trend has significantly broadened our horizons and positively impacted society. One notable advantage is that customers can now access a diverse range of high-quality products while discovering the rich cultures of different countries. Additionally, individuals from economically disadvantaged nations can now access the latest products. For instance, Vietnam may have less advanced manufacturing capabilities compared to America, but thanks to international trade, high-tech devices like laptops and smartphones produced in America are accessible to Vietnamese residents. This access to essential utilities has improved their quality of life.\nAnother advantage is the expansion of the market, which helps prevent monopolistic pricing.

For instance, to attract customers to their flagship product, the iPhone, Samsung regularly innovates the design and functionality of their smartphones.\nIn conclusion, despite some minor criticisms, I believe that globalization has given consumers a significant advantage by providing them with a wide array of options from high-quality producers. I hope that this trend continues to make the world a better place for all of humanity."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that government funding should be prioritized for education and culture over healthcare?",
    "paragraph": "It is widely acknowledged that government funding should contribute to the improvement of society as a whole. However, there is an ongoing debate about which sector should take precedence when it comes to state subsidies. Some argue that the government should offer its citizens free healthcare, while others believe that these funds should be channeled into education and culture. In this essay, we will examine both perspectives before explaining why I support the latter view.\nOn one hand, it is understandable why some people propose a healthcare system that is free of charge. The primary reason in favor of this idea is that it would enable more people, particularly those who are financially disadvantaged, to access healthcare services. This, in turn, could lead to a healthier population, which is essential for sustainable economic development. However, this line of thinking has its drawbacks, as the substantial costs associated with running a free healthcare system could strain the government's finances, especially in impoverished and developing nations with limited resources. Overspending on healthcare in these countries could result in insufficient funds for other crucial sectors, such as transportation, which could ultimately hinder their economic growth.\nI align myself with those who argue that instead of fully subsidizing healthcare, the government should invest more in culture and education. Regarding culture, increased financial support in this area can help promote national cultural values globally. This is arguably crucial for boosting the national tourism industry, which could, in turn, generate significant revenues for the government. As for education, additional subsidies can enhance the quality of the educational system, potentially leading to a more educated workforce. This undoubtedly serves as a precursor to a thriving economy in the future. When compared to providing free healthcare, investing in education and culture appears to be a more economically advantageous approach.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid reasons to support the implementation of a free healthcare system, I would argue that it would be wiser to allocate those funds to the fields of education and culture."

    "paragraph": "It is widely believed that violence depicted on television can significantly impact children's tendency toward aggressive behavior. As a result, there have been calls to forbid programs that showcase violent scenes. In this essay, I find this suggestion entirely reasonable, and I aim to explain my perspective.\nTo begin with, opponents of banning violent broadcasts often argue that it may reduce the appeal of such programs, leading to a decrease in viewership. However, this appeal could potentially result in more severe consequences. For instance, young children may develop aggressive tendencies due to excessive exposure to violence on television. This inclination can arguably serve as a breeding ground for increased crime rates, posing a threat to society. To prevent this possible scenario, it is wise to restrict programs that contain violence.\nCertainly, there is an argument that violent films or programs are already required to provide warnings to viewers that such content is unsuitable for those under 18. According to this perspective, it is the responsibility of parents to ensure their children avoid such programs. Nevertheless, it is practically impossible for parents to closely monitor everything their children watch. Therefore, it would be safer to implement a blanket ban on broadcasting violent scenes in the first place.\nIn conclusion, due to the reasons mentioned above, while there are valid arguments against banning TV programs featuring violent scenes, I am convinced that these reasons are largely debatable. Moreover, prohibiting such content can be beneficial in terms of safeguarding children from harmful influences."

    "paragraph": "Television's portrayal of violence is often blamed for influencing children towards aggressive behavior. Consequently, there have been calls to prohibit programs featuring violent scenes. In my view, I wholeheartedly support this idea for the following reasons.\nCritics may argue that eliminating violent scenes would diminish the entertainment value and viewership of the film industry. However, this appeal can lead to severe consequences, including children's exposure to excessive violence, which may nurture misguided perspectives and pose a threat to societal morals. Therefore, prudence must be the foremost consideration when contemplating a ban on televised violence.\nOthers argue that most contemporary movies come with warnings about violence or age appropriateness. According to this perspective, children should learn to choose suitable movies themselves, rather than restricting violent content. Parents, they contend, are responsible for guiding their children's choices and educating them to avoid programs with violent scenes. However, it is challenging for parents to constantly supervise their children to ensure compliance. Hence, implementing a comprehensive prohibition on violence appears to be a safer approach to address this issue.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of banning violent scenes on television, the reasons in favor of such a ban are compelling. Indeed, officially forbidding the depiction of violence on television appears to be the most effective means of protecting children from potential moral degradation."

    "paragraph": "In today's world, the primary concern revolves around maintaining good health, which is paramount in our society. Consequently, some argue that healthcare services should not be controlled by profit-driven corporations. This essay aims to explore both the advantages and disadvantages of private health care, ultimately concluding that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that medical services provided by private companies can be disadvantageous to a certain extent. The first significant drawback is the exorbitant cost associated with private services, rendering them unaffordable for many individuals. To elaborate further, certain advanced equipment like medical imaging machines or analyzers can inflate expenses two to threefold, limiting access to medical care, particularly for those with financial constraints. Another severe consequence is that the pursuit of profits may lead to unethical practices, such as unnecessary medical procedures or overprescribing medication to generate more revenue. This not only erodes the trust between patients and healthcare providers but also jeopardizes public health.\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks of private health care, I am convinced that the benefits of these organizations are more noticeable, supported by a plethora of compelling reasons. The primary rationale is that patients can reap substantial benefits, including shorter waiting times and access to modern healthcare systems. This can be further reinforced by the fact that personalized medical services with private consultants and doctors save patients time during appointments and offer specialized treatment options. Another justification is that private healthcare providers can significantly alleviate the workload of public medical centers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily number of patients surged, overwhelming state hospitals and straining the public healthcare system. However, private healthcare providers stepped in to address these issues by providing additional hospital beds, medical personnel, and testing facilities.\nIn conclusion, while it is indisputable that medical services run by profit-making companies can entail several disadvantages, I contend that these drawbacks are outweighed by the benefits they offer."

    "paragraph": "It is often suggested that schools should prioritize academic success and examination performance, while skills like cooking, dressmaking, and woodwork should be acquired from family and friends. In my view, while academic achievements hold undeniable importance, there is room to include practical life skills within the school curriculum through outdoor activities.\nThere are compelling reasons behind the belief in the significance of academic success and exam results. Firstly, strong academic performance opens doors to numerous university opportunities, increasing the chances of students gaining admission to their preferred institutions. For instance, Vietnamese students can leverage their high school academic records to apply to a variety of universities, improving their prospects of acceptance even before taking the entrance exams. Additionally, schools were originally established with the primary objective of imparting academic knowledge to students, alleviating the need to burden them with the responsibility of acquiring life skills.\nNevertheless, I firmly believe that soft skills and life skills are equally essential for students' future well-being. Firstly, as individuals mature and eventually become independent, they must possess practical skills like cooking and dressmaking to navigate daily life successfully. Such skills equip young adults with the ability to live autonomously without relying on others. Secondly, governments can incorporate outdoor activities into the school curriculum to teach students fundamental life skills, which will prove invaluable in their future endeavors. Furthermore, these activities offer students a much-needed respite from the stress of absorbing copious amounts of academic information.\nIn conclusion, while academic achievements and examination success remain paramount in the realm of education, there is a valid case for integrating life skills into the school curriculum through outdoor activities. This approach ensures that students receive valuable knowledge and capabilities that will serve them well in their future lives."

    "paragraph": "Considering that deciding to have children is one of the most crucial choices in a person's life, an increasing number of individuals are opting to delay parenthood in recent times. This essay aims to elucidate the driving factors behind this trend before asserting that it is indeed a positive development.\nThere are two primary reasons why people are inclined to have children later in life. First and foremost, young individuals today prioritize establishing a successful career. To ensure they can comfortably cover various childcare expenses, such as food, education, and clothing, without experiencing financial strain, many young adults opt to first build a financially stable career. For instance, a prosperous couple would be in a position to provide high-quality necessities and services for their children, thereby facilitating their overall development. Another compelling reason is that individuals aspire to enrich their life experiences through activities such as travel and exposure to different lifestyles, which can enhance their parenting skills.\nI would argue that delaying parenthood offers significant advantages for both families and society. Regarding the former, postponed childbirth increases the likelihood of children being raised in an optimal manner. For example, older parents tend to have greater financial resources at their disposal, enabling them to provide their children with access to prestigious educational institutions. Concerning the latter, postponing childbearing can help mitigate various social issues. This viewpoint is reinforced by the fact that couples who become parents later in life often lead happier and more harmonious lives, which can contribute to a lower divorce rate and, consequently, a decrease in crime and domestic violence.\nIn conclusion, the desire to prioritize building a promising career and enhancing parenting skills underpins this trend.

Some argue that the primary purpose of this endeavor is environmental preservation, while others believe it primarily serves business interests. However, I contend that both viewpoints are valid, and international cooperation can simultaneously benefit both aspects.\nThere are numerous compelling reasons why governments have come together to address pressing global issues, particularly environmental concerns. Firstly, the environment is not the exclusive domain of any single country. When pollution occurs in one region, it inevitably impacts surrounding areas and can even have far-reaching global consequences, potentially becoming a widespread phenomenon. Secondly, environmental challenges are often of a catastrophic nature and necessitate collective efforts from diverse nations. For example, addressing the deterioration of environmental quality in developing countries can be accelerated with the assistance of technological advancements from more developed nations.\nNotwithstanding the advantages mentioned above, international collaboration can also be seen as an opportunity for countries to engage in business expansion. Undoubtedly, this endeavor can broaden the scope of trade beyond domestic boundaries, creating favorable conditions for cross-border transactions. For instance, since Vietnam opened up to the world, numerous business agreements have been forged, enticing corporations from developed countries to invest their resources in this nation. Furthermore, thanks to globalization, many businesses operate subsidiaries worldwide, generating numerous job opportunities for local populations. This not only enhances their quality of life but also bolsters the financial strength of these corporations.\nIn conclusion, international cooperation is a significant trend that holds importance for both the economy and the environment, and thus, it should be actively encouraged."

Personally, I agree with the notion that it is crucial to make the most of the older buildings.\nIt is understandable why tax revenue should be invested in newly constructed buildings. Firstly, renovating an existing structure demands significant government funding and involves considerable efforts, in contrast to the creation of a new one. For instance, when renovating Hue's Ancient Capital, a substantial amount of funds was allocated by state officials for facilities and a multitude of experts to preserve its original beauty. Furthermore, the emergence of modern and unique structures boosts the tourism industry by attracting numerous visitors, thereby contributing to national progress in various aspects.\nDespite the numerous advantages of erecting new buildings mentioned above, I am of the opinion that old structures should be repurposed. To begin with, sustainability is a key factor in favor of reusing these buildings. This is because the process of demolishing and constructing numerous new structures is on the verge of exacerbating environmental problems. Hence, to promote a greener future, utilizing the ancient ones is a more viable option. Additionally, historical events have shaped old architecture, making it a reflection of the nation's unique architectural heritage. This, in turn, instills a sense of cultural appreciation in the younger generation and helps convey traditional values to foreigners.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that government funding should be directed towards ancient buildings due to their positive impact on the environment and their role in fostering a sense of community among residents."

Therefore, the question arises: should healthcare services be operated by profit-seeking companies? Personally, I agree with this idea, but I also recognize the numerous advantages of private healthcare services.\nFirstly, public hospitals in most countries often face issues of overcrowding and insufficient funding. This places immense pressure on doctors, nurses, and patients, as quick recoveries are essential to accommodate more individuals. Opting for private healthcare services can alleviate this burden on the public system, potentially reducing the government's financial burden. Furthermore, those who choose private healthcare can enjoy various benefits, including high-quality and speedy treatments, short waiting times for appointments and surgeries, as well as more comfortable, private facilities.\nHowever, while private healthcare boasts several advantages, it comes with its share of disadvantages. To begin with, private healthcare insurance can be prohibitively expensive, making it unaffordable for many people. Additionally, individuals typically pay monthly premiums, regardless of whether they utilize the system or not. Consequently, many individuals end up paying substantial sums each year for private healthcare services they may never need, which some consider a financial waste. Furthermore, critics argue that private healthcare exacerbates inequality among a nation's citizens, as only the affluent can access the best and quickest treatments available.\nIn conclusion, I believe that as long as governments strive to provide a high standard of healthcare facilities and services for the general public, private healthcare services can coexist and offer numerous advantages that may outweigh the disadvantages."

In my view, the advantages of this trend far outweigh the disadvantages.\nFirst and foremost, this development has expanded our horizons and positively impacted society. One significant benefit is that consumers now have access to a diverse range of high-quality products and the opportunity to explore different cultures from around the world. Moreover, citizens from less affluent nations can now acquire the latest products. For example, Vietnam has a less developed manufacturing sector, while America produces cutting-edge products and facilities.

Instead, people are encouraged to use public transportation like buses, taxis, and the metro on these vehicle-free days. This essay aims to explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend and determine whether its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.\nOn one hand, there are some disadvantages to implementing vehicle-free days. Firstly, local residents may experience limited mobility. This means they are restricted to using public transportation, which may not have routes that conveniently connect to their desired destinations. For example, if someone's destination is far from a bus station, they may have to walk a considerable distance to reach it. Furthermore, choosing taxis as an alternative can be expensive compared to using their private vehicles. For instance, a family of four can travel 100km at the cost of a gallon of gasoline in their own car, while commuting the same distance by taxi can amount to several hundred dollars. Secondly, using public transportation on vehicle-free days can result in crowded and sometimes uncomfortable experiences. Commuters have to share the confined space inside public vehicles with many others, which can be distressing, particularly for individuals with claustrophobia. Some people might also face issues such as sexual harassment or unauthorized recording while using public transportation on these days.\nOn the other hand, there are notable advantages to temporarily banning private vehicles in cities. Firstly, governments can make a significant contribution to addressing environmental issues. By prohibiting the use of private vehicles for short periods, there is a substantial reduction in the emission of toxic fumes from vehicles, which helps mitigate the risk of air pollution and maintains a healthier living environment for residents. Additionally, this policy conserves the fuel that would have been used by private vehicles, thus preventing the wastage of natural, non-renewable resources. Furthermore, by promoting the use of public transportation on vehicle-free days, governments can raise awareness among people about eco-friendly travel options, encouraging them to adopt more sustainable modes of commuting. By adjusting their commuting habits, individuals can reduce their ecological footprint, ultimately leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions.\nIn conclusion, despite the presence of some drawbacks, it is recommended that cities consider implementing vehicle-free days on a permanent basis due to the significant positive effects it has on the environment."

Do you agree or disagree?\"\nImproved Essay:\nWhile some believe that students should engage in homework due to its significance, I acknowledge that this approach may be suitable for many individuals. However, I hold the view that others prioritize extracurricular activities over homework alone.\nOn one hand, there are several reasons why assigning homework is beneficial. One key rationale is that it plays a crucial role in helping teachers assess students' abilities and identify those who require additional support. When a student struggles with their math exercises, it signals a need for the teacher to enhance that student's skills. Furthermore, these assignments not only enable students to practice and reinforce lessons from school but also teach them how to create a well-structured plan based on their class schedule and homework load. Most students who organize their work effectively, complete their homework promptly, and exhibit diligence, dedication, and independence are more likely to enjoy a prosperous and successful life.\nOn the other hand, for many students, homework consumes so much time that they are left with insufficient opportunities for extracurricular activities such as sports or socializing with friends. In many families, especially among Asian parents, the prevailing belief is that a focus on academics is the best path to secure a prosperous future with good job prospects. Consequently, students invest the majority of their time in academics, often neglecting the development of essential soft skills, which are highly valuable. This heavy emphasis on homework can result in children having limited interaction with their parents and even feeling intimidated by them. From a certain perspective, homework can deprive children of their childhood and hinder the development of vital interpersonal skills, such as effective communication.\nIn some developed countries like Finland, homework is either optional or nonexistent, allowing students to pursue their interests and passions freely. This approach has proven to be remarkably effective, as people in such countries tend to possess a wide array of life skills and report high levels of happiness.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that homework can be a vital element for many students, particularly those who are enthusiastic about learning or pursuing in-depth studies, it is not the definitive solution for everyone's engagement in social activities. I believe that students in secondary and high school may benefit from homework to enhance their education.

Some believe it's beneficial to expand their personal horizons, while others disagree. This essay argues that despite several disadvantages of international exchange visits for students, they are crucial for their long-term development.\nTo start with, having more exchange opportunities offers numerous benefits. Firstly, students can gain high-quality academic knowledge related to their chosen fields. Learning from distinguished professors from around the world can help students understand and apply these lessons effectively. Additionally, participating in these exchange programs exposes students to innovative developments related to their future careers. For instance, exposure to advanced technology during the manufacturing process can enhance their productivity and reduce expenses. As a result, students develop a deeper understanding and broaden their awareness.\nHowever, it's undeniable that there are significant challenges during student exchange programs that can affect their determination. One of the main challenges is cultural shock. Being unfamiliar with the local culture can hinder the learning process and the formation of new friendships. Moreover, it can disrupt their daily routines for an extended period if not managed properly. Furthermore, being far from their hometown during international exchange visits can lead to a loss of identity. For example, when young individuals embrace a new lifestyle and customs, they may tend to forget or disregard their traditional values. In the long term, many long-standing morals and identities may not endure for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while many students can gain a more positive perspective through global exchange visits, it's true that these experiences can pose a threat to national identities and familiarity with one's home environment.

While detailed planning is undoubtedly crucial, I firmly believe that personal efforts and luck play a more significant role in a successful life.\nThere are two major benefits to having specific plans that play a significant role in achieving favorable outcomes. Firstly, it helps individuals in pursuing their goals. This is because they can set both short-term and long-term objectives with a clear path to motivate them, thus enhancing the execution process. For example, Elon Musk overcame numerous challenges and achieved groundbreaking success with SpaceX due to careful strategic planning. Additionally, detailed planning enables people to stay focused and avoid distractions, which can otherwise hinder their efforts.\nHowever, an alternative perspective suggests that prearranged plans pale in comparison to perseverance and luck. The primary reason for this is that persistence is vital for attaining success. It encourages individuals to acknowledge their limitations and explore alternative paths after encountering unforeseen failures, making them more resilient in overcoming obstacles and pursuing their goals. For instance, Jack Ma tirelessly worked to establish one of China's most successful companies, despite facing various challenges, such as a lack of financial resources. Furthermore, good fortune provides opportunities for growth. It is undeniable that individuals born into affluent families have more chances for personal and career development compared to those from less privileged backgrounds.\nIn conclusion, I believe that both perspectives have their merits.

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that the benefits of international exchange opportunities for students outweigh the drawbacks?",
    "paragraph": "The contentious question of whether young students should have access to numerous global exchange opportunities at their school has been a topic of debate among educationalists. Some argue that it is advantageous to broaden their personal abilities, while others counter this argument. This essay argues that despite several drawbacks of international exchange visits for students, they are essential for their overall development in the long term.\nTo begin with, the availability of more opportunities for exchange visits offers numerous benefits. First and foremost, students can gain high-quality academic knowledge related to their chosen majors. Learning from distinguished lecturers from around the world can help students comprehend and apply these lessons effectively. Additionally, going abroad through these exchange programs exposes students to innovative breakthroughs related to their future careers. For example, exposure to advanced machinery during the manufacturing process can enhance their productivity and reduce necessary expenses. Consequently, students develop a deeper understanding and broaden their awareness.\nConversely, it is undeniable that there are significant challenges during student exchange programs that can hinder their determination. Chief among these is the cultural shock. Being unfamiliar with the local culture can impede the learning process and hinder the formation of new friendships. Moreover, it can disrupt their daily routines for an extended period if not managed properly. Furthermore, being far away from their hometown during international exchange visits can lead to a loss of identity. For instance, when young individuals embrace a new lifestyle and customs, they may tend to forget or disregard their traditional values. In the long term, many long-standing morals and identities may not endure for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while many students can gain a more positive perspective through global exchange visits, it is true that these experiences can pose a threat to national identities and familiarity with one's home environment. From my perspective, each student should carefully plan to mitigate any unexpected consequences in order to fully utilize the advantages of international exchange visits."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that the advantages of private healthcare outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "paragraph": "In today's world, maintaining good health is of paramount importance to everyone in society. Consequently, some argue that healthcare services should not be controlled by profit-oriented corporations. This essay aims to examine both the advantages and disadvantages of private healthcare, ultimately concluding that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\nOn one hand, it is undeniable that medical services provided by private companies can have some disadvantages. One significant drawback is the exorbitant cost associated with private healthcare services, making them unaffordable for many individuals. To elaborate further, the speed and state-of-the-art equipment of these services can drive up the expenses, limiting access to medical care, particularly for those with financial constraints. Another serious concern is that profit-driven decisions may lead to unethical practices in healthcare. For instance, in profit-oriented healthcare systems, financial considerations may take precedence over patient needs, potentially resulting in over-treatment or unnecessary medical procedures.\nHowever, despite these drawbacks, I am convinced that the advantages of private healthcare organizations outweigh these disadvantages for several compelling reasons. Firstly, patients can benefit greatly from shorter waiting times and modern healthcare systems. This is reinforced by the fact that private healthcare services can offer personalized consultations with doctors, helping patients save time on appointments and receive specialized treatment. Another justification is that private healthcare can alleviate the workload of public medical centers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the number of patients seeking medical attention, overwhelming state hospitals and burdening the public healthcare system. Private healthcare services can play a vital role in addressing such situations.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that medical services operated by profit-making companies can have several disadvantages, I maintain that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that imprisonment is a more effective solution than education to prevent crimes?",
    "paragraph": "Imprisonment is often considered a more effective solution than education to prevent crimes. In my opinion, although investing in educational resources can lower crime rates to a certain extent, severe punishments still play a more crucial role in surmounting this persistent problem.\nProponents of education argue for its positive impact on society in the long term. The motives for criminal activity are often deeply rooted in underlying factors, ranging from poverty to a lack of access to formal education. Therefore, governments can allocate funds to ensure free and accessible education for individuals from impoverished backgrounds, improving their chances of obtaining well-paid jobs. There is anecdotal evidence that in countries with low crime rates, such as Singapore and Canada, the general population has easy access to education and is thus less likely to resort to criminal means for support.\nHowever, imprisonment is justifiable as it best ensures public safety. Firstly, criminals cannot continue committing crimes when they are serving sentences in jails. Isolating criminals is the best way to protect society for extended periods, especially in cases of convicted murderers, rapists, kidnappers, and other serious offenses, eliminating even the slightest chance these criminals will continue to harm other individuals. Sentencing criminals to prisons can also effectively deter criminal acts. Those with the intention of engaging in illegal activities will naturally have to consider the risk of potentially losing their freedom. This is exemplified in nations with severe sentencing laws, such as Vietnam, where the government sentences illegal drug traffickers to life imprisonment and has successfully reduced the number of drug-related incidents as a result.\nIn conclusion, while educational provision can partially reduce crime rates, putting offenders in jails is by far the most effective form of deterrence. Governments should naturally combine both methods to achieve the most desirable outcomes."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that a person's true worth should be determined by their character rather than external factors such as social standing and material possessions?",
    "paragraph": "In today's contemporary society, there is a prevalent belief that a person's value is often assessed based on their social standing and material possessions. Consequently, qualities like ethics, integrity, and wisdom are no longer held in high regard. From my perspective, I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that an individual's true worth should be determined by their character rather than external factors. This essay will elaborate on the key points supporting this notion.\nTo begin with, social status and wealth do not contribute significantly to long-term personal growth. This is because class and monetary wealth are contingent upon individuals' efforts to accumulate and maintain them. However, not all individuals in privileged positions can sustain their status if they lack the requisite abilities and the approval of the people around them. Furthermore, it is predicted that in the near future, currency may become obsolete due to improved living conditions for residents. According to Karl Marx, after the era of capitalism, the world will transition into socialism, guaranteeing a contented life for citizens, rendering the concepts of money and social classes unnecessary.\nDelving deeper into this notion, it can be persuasively argued that human qualities play a pivotal role in achieving success. When an individual consistently treats others with kindness and offers help to the best of their abilities, they are likely to receive support from those they have assisted, expediting their path to success. Consequently, they earn praise and respect from their peers and reap financial rewards from their achievements.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that human virtues should be universally acknowledged as the true criteria for evaluating a person's worth. Therefore, individuals should prioritize nurturing their good conduct and attitudes to become exemplary citizens."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that the increasing competition for employment opportunities between older and younger individuals is a problem for the labor market? What can be done to address this problem?",
    "paragraph": "Workforce competition between older and younger individuals vying for the same jobs is currently a noteworthy concern. In my view, this phenomenon can have unfavorable implications for the labor market. Therefore, it is crucial for governments and companies to take action to address these issues.\nThe rising rate of unemployment among the youth, which can result from the aforementioned trend, is a significant concern. Younger workers, with less experience, may encounter challenges in distinguishing themselves and gaining recognition comparable to their older counterparts, who are generally perceived as more experienced. Consequently, youth unemployment can lead to social issues, such as homelessness and juvenile delinquency. Furthermore, as individuals age, their health may deteriorate, potentially limiting their capacity to handle multiple tasks and requiring greater mental focus, which can result in reduced productivity.\nTo address the problem of youth unemployment, businesses should actively promote more internship opportunities for less experienced young employees. In Vietnam, numerous universities have established partnerships with businesses that offer apprenticeships or exchange programs to help students enhance their skills. By gaining practical knowledge through these initiatives, students can significantly increase their chances of securing employment. Another effective approach is to improve the quality of life for the elderly by implementing comprehensive welfare programs. For instance, instead of relying on employment for healthcare expenses, the elderly can receive healthcare services from the government, including home visits and outpatient rehabilitation services.\nIn conclusion, intergenerational competition for employment opportunities can lead to youth unemployment and reduced productivity. This underscores the importance of collaboration between the government and private companies to address these challenges."

    "question": "To what extent do you agree that boxing should be banned in the modern age?",
    "paragraph": "Sports and leisure activities serve not only as a means of physical exercise but also as a source of entertainment and relaxation for individuals and communities alike. Therefore, some people argue that a sport as extreme as boxing is inappropriate in the modern age due to the physical injuries it frequently inflicts upon its participants. From my perspective, I strongly agree with this viewpoint for several reasons.\nTo begin with, it is undeniable that boxing matches showcased in the media often emphasize moral principles and provide a spectacle that includes respect for opponents, adherence to rules, and fair play. However, underground boxing, which appeals to a particular audience, is often marred by disturbing elements such as foul language, disregard for opponents, violent punches, brutal scenes, and an unseemly appearance resulting from intense physical contact. Consequently, this perilous sport is ill-suited to exist in today's world.\nAnother compelling reason supporting my agreement with this perspective is the case of Mike Tyson, a prominent American boxer with numerous noteworthy accomplishments in his career. As Tyson grew older, he began to suffer from serious health issues stemming from his past boxing matches, including osteoporosis and vision-related problems. Furthermore, scientific studies on Tyson's health indicated that he was unlikely to fully recover from the injuries incurred during his boxing career, exacerbated by the natural aging process. In this context, I would argue that this hazardous sport poses a significant threat to the physical well-being of its participants and should be banned on safety grounds.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that eliminating boxing is a reasonable and responsible course of action due to the detrimental impact it has on the physical health of its athletes."

    "paragraph": "In accordance with Dhawan et al., this occurs in 30% of young patients with acute liver failure (ALF) who need a transplant, and in 60% of those who pass away before getting a transplant. The level of copper in the blood, which includes both ceruloplasmin-bound and non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper, is typically low when WD is diagnosed in non-acute cases. However, in WD-related ALF, it is likely to be high because non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper is released from the failing liver. Additionally, urinary copper production should be very high. When examining the liver tissue through a biopsy, we often observe multi-lobular confluent necrosis, which is consistently present alongside cirrhosis. However, the presence of numerous glycogen nuclei with relatively mild steatosis may suggest WD, and one might also observe many apoptotic hepatocytes (Schilsky, M. L. et al. 2022).\nChronic Hepatitis"
